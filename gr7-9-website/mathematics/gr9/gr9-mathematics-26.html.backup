 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-opener-no-indent">In this chapter, you will
    develop and practise some critical data analysis skills. This
    means looking at reported data and analysing the whole data
    handling cycle for this data. You need to decide which way of
    representing data is best in a given situation. In summarising
    data, some measures are more appropriate for different types of
    data. You also need to recognise some ways in which bias can
    appear in data, including methods of collecting, representing
    and summarising data.</p>
  
    <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="toc-id-12">Which graph is best?</h2>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-no-indent">You have learnt that certain types of
    graphs are best for displaying certain kinds of information.
    The type of graph depends mostly on the type of data that needs
    to be represented. Here is a summary of the advantages of
    different types of graphs:</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">
      <p class="Body-content-no-indent"><span class="char-style-override-2"><b>Tables</b></span> show more information
      than graphs but the patterns are not as easy to see. They do
      not give a visual impression of particular trends.</p>
      
       <p class="Body-content-no-indent"><b>Pie charts</b> show a whole divided into parts. They
show how the parts relate to each other and how the
parts relate to a whole. They do not show the
quantities involved.
</p>
       <p class="Body-content-no-indent"/><p class="Body-content-no-indent"><b>Bar graphs</b> show the amounts or quantities
involved but do not show the relationship as
effectively as pie charts. They are useful for showing
<b>quantitative</b> data. Bar charts allow us to compare
the quantities of different categories, for example,
the sales of different items.
</p><p class="Body-content-no-indent"/><p class="Body-content-no-indent">A <b>double-bar graph</b> is used to compare two or
more things for each category. For example, we could
use a double-bar graph to compare the differences
between males and females.
</p><p class="Body-content-no-indent"><b>Histograms</b> are used to represent numerical data
that is grouped into equal class intervals. Histograms
are useful to show the way the data is spread out.
</p><p class="Body-content-no-indent"><b>Broken-line graphs</b> show trends or changes in
quantities over time.

      order. Half the values in the data set are lower than the
      median and half of them are higher than the median. The
      median is often the average used when data values are not
      uniformly distributed, because the mean is affected by
      extreme values in the data set, while the median is not. For
      example, house prices vary widely, so the median would be a
      better description of the data than the mean. When the median
      is given in a report, the writer should state that they are
      using the median or middle value.</li>

      <li class="Body-bullet--indented-">The <b>mode</b> is the
      number that occurs most often in a set of data. For example,
      if we collect data about people's favourite colours, the data
      set would be a list of colours, and the mode would be the
      colour that comes up most often. The mode can also be used
      for numbers. Not all data sets have a mode, because sometimes
      none of the numbers occurs more than once.</li>
    </ul><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Example</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-no-indent">The standard way of reporting house
    prices in South Africa and internationally is the median house
    price, which is used by economists in financial reports. The
    median is regarded as more useful than the mean house price
    because the sale of a few expensive houses would increase the
    mean, but would not affect the median.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body">If a bank gives bonds for eight houses to the
    value of R100 000, and for two houses to the value of R1
    million, then the mean would be R280 000. This does not seem to
    be an accurate reflection of the value of the houses, because
    it is distorted by the higher values. The median house price
    would be R100 000, which is an accurate reflection of the
    prices.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body">Remember that the median is the middle point,
    and half of the values fall below the median, and half above.
    If the median is lower than the mean, this shows us that there
    are high values that are distorting the mean.</p>

    <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="toc-id-15">Misleading graphs</h2>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-no-indent">The media (newspapers, magazines,
    television), regularly use graphs to show information.
    Unfortunately, the information is often manipulated to
    emphasise a particular result. This may be because the writer
    simply wants to make his or her argument more obvious to the
    reader.</p>

    <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Changing the
    scale of the axis </h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-no-indent">If you change the scale of the
    vertical axis on bar graphs and line graphs, you will change
    the way the graphs look. For a bar graph, the larger the spaces
    between the numbers on the vertical axis, the bigger the
    difference between the bars. The smaller the spaces between the
    numbers on the axis, the smaller the difference in the height
    of the bars. The same is true for a line graph which will
    either have sharp points or be much flatter depending on how
    you have changed the scale.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-no-indent para-style-override-2"><b>Example</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-no-indent">The two broken-line graphs below show
    the same sales data for a business over a period of six months.
    Which graph gives the more accurate impression?</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-no-indent"><span><img class="medium" src="Maths_English_LB_gr9_term4_1-web-resources/image/155376.png" alt="155376.png"/></span> </p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body-no-indent">Graph B has a different scale on the
    vertical axis. The vertical axis does not start at 0 and so
    <span class="char-style-override-2"><b>two</b></span> blocks on the
    vertical axis represent 100 items instead of only <span class="char-style-override-2"><b>one</b></span> block, as in Graph A. This
    makes it look as if the sales increased rapidly over the six
    months.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Body">Note that it is not necessarily wrong to change
    the scale on the axes or not to start at 0. For example, graphs
    showing stock exchange fluctuations rarely show the origin on
    the graph and stockbrokers are taught to interpret the graphs
    in that form. Sometimes small changes in data values have
    important effects and in these cases, it may be valid to change
    the scale to show these.</p>
