<p/>

<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>In Gr. 4 learners covered the basic facts about the Moon: its lack of air and water, size relative to the Earth and its position with respect to the Sun. They also observed the Moon's phases. In Gr. 6 learners learnt about the Moon's motion in space: it revolves around the Earth whilst rotating on its spin axis. In this chapter, learners will develop an understanding of how the phases of the Moon are related to the relative positions of the Earth, Moon and Sun. They will also be introduced to the concept of gravity, (covered in more detail in Gr. 9: Energy and Change strand), and the influence of the Moon's and Sun's gravitational pulls on the Earth's oceans which result in tides.</p>

<p>The main aims of this chapter are to ensure that learners understand the following:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The Moon is smaller than the Earth and orbits around the Earth in 27.3 days as the Earth revolves around the Sun.</li>
<li>The Moon is held in orbit around the Earth by the force of gravity. In turn the Earth and all the other planets in the solar system are held in orbit around the Sun by the force of gravity.</li>
<li>All masses experience the force of gravity, and the size of the force exerted is dependent upon the mass of the objects and their distance from each other.</li>
<li>The combined gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's oceans cause the ocean tides.</li>
</ul><p>2.1 Relative positions (1.5 hours)</p>

<p>Earth's only natural satellite is simply called the Moon because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Other moons in our solar system are given names so they won't be confused with each other.</p>
</div>
<p>The Moon is the most obvious feature in our night sky and has captivated people for thousands of years. Ancient cultures recorded the apparent motion of the Moon through the sky and made calendars which used the phases of the Moon to mark the months. In fact some religious calendars still use a lunar (Moon) based calendar rather than the official solar (Sun) based calendar used today in South Africa and most of the Western world (called the Gregorian calendar). The Moon's influence on the Earth is also important to us in other ways as you will discover in this chapter.</p>

<p>The Moon is actually covered in a layer of lunar 'soil' called regolith. This is why you can see astronauts' footprints on the Moon. Lunar 'soil' has different properties to soil on Earth, most significant is that terrestrial soil has organic matter in it.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Google the Moon</strong></p>

<p>This is an optional activity to do with your learners if you have internet access. You can use it as an alternative to the previous activity where the images are provided.</p>

<p>This activity is a nice way to incorporate ICT into a science lesson. The Google Earth software can be downloaded for free directly onto your computer from the following web address: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.google.com/earth/explore/products/"> http://www.google.com/earth/explore/products/</a> The software contains an interactive map of the Earth, Moon and Mars. Switching to 'Moon mode', learners can look at the surface of the Moon in amazing detail, rotating, and zooming in or out of the map. Additional information about the 6 Apollo landing sites is also available with photos and short videos. Both low and high resolution images of the Moon can be studied along with contour maps to explore the heights and depths of the craters. If you do not have access to a computer then an alternative activity is to show students a variety of photographs of the Moon.</p>

<p>The Earth, just like all the other planets in the solar system, travels around the Sun, completing one revolution every year. As the Earth travels around the Sun it has a companion in space: our Moon!</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The time that it takes an object to make one complete orbit around another object, relative to the stars, is called the orbital period or synodic period.</p>
</div>
<p>The Moon orbits around the Earth completing one revolution every 27.3 days. Our Moon rotates on its own axis and experiences daytime and dark nighttime just like the Earth does. However, the Moon spins much more slowly than the Earth does and completes one rotation on its axis once every 27.3 days. Did you notice that the Moon takes the same amount of time to spin on its axis as it does to orbit completely around Earth? This means that from the Earth, we always see the same side of the Moon (called the 'nearside'). The side we do not see from Earth, called the 'farside', has been mapped during space missions to the Moon.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The <strong>sidereal period</strong> of the Moon is mentioned in the previous paragraph, namely the Moon completes an orbit around the Earth about once every 27.3 days. This is not to be confused with the Moon's <strong>synodic period</strong>, which is 29.5 days. The synodic period of the Moon is due to the Earth moving in its orbit about the Sun at the same time, and so it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth.</p>

<p>The Moon revolves around the Earth at an average orbital speed of about 1 km per second!</p>
</div>
<p>Viewed from above, the Moon moves in an anti-clockwise direction around the Earth. The Moon's orbit is not a perfect circle, it is elliptical, so its distance from Earth varies as it revolves around the Earth. The average distance is about 385 000 km, which is about 60 times the radius of the Earth itself. For comparison, the Earth's average distance from the Sun is 149 597 871 km, or about 23 481 times the radius of the Earth. You can see now why the Moon is called Earth's close companion!</p>

<p>In Gr. 6, learners would have done some activities to act out the revolution of the Moon around the Earth as the Earth orbits the Moon.

<p>We have now looked at the relative positions and movement of the Earth, Moon and Sun. Let's extend this knowledge to learn about a solar eclipse.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Total Solar Eclipse</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In this activity, the idea that the apparent size of an object depends upon its distance from an observer is reinforced. Learners will find that although the Sun is much much larger than the Moon, it appears about the same size in the sky because it is much more distant than the Moon.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>

<p>Look at the image below. It shows a total solar eclipse which you learnt about in Gr. 6. This happens when the Moon passes directly in front of the Sun and blocks the Sun's light. The bright light from the Sun is blocked, allowing us to see the very faint outer edge of the Sun's atmosphere, called the corona. We normally cannot see the corona as it is swamped by the bright light from the Sun. When you look at the size of the Moon in the sky compared with the size of the Sun in the sky you see that they are very similar. We call this the <strong>angular size</strong>. This is because the Moon is much closer than the Sun. The Moon appears large enough from Earth to totally block out the Sun's light.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0007.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A total solar eclipse.

<p/><p/>

        
<p>Although the Sun is much larger than the Moon, it is much more distant. As objects appear to look smaller and smaller the further away they are, the Sun appears smaller than it is in reality. The Moon also appears smaller than it is in reality, however it is much closer to the Earth than the Sun is and so its apparent size isn't reduced as much as the Sun's is. Just by chance, the Sun and moon are currently at distances where they have the same angular size viewed from the Earth's surface.</p>

<p>A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth, Moon and Sun are aligned in a straight line with the Moon placed in between the Earth and the Sun. Just by chance, the Sun and Moon are currently at distances where they have the same angular size viewed from the Earth's surface. If the angular size of the Moon were smaller, it would not be large enough to completely block the Sun and we wouldn't have total solar eclipses! The picture below shows the relative alignment of the Sun, Earth and Moon during a solar eclipse.</p>

<p>Learners will most likely be familiar with the change in the Moon's appearance over the course of a month, the lunar phases. Each lunar phase cycle from New Moon to New Moon takes 29.5 days, which is slightly longer than the Moon takes to complete one revolution around the Earth (27.3 days). This is because during the 27.3 days it takes for the Moon to revolve around the Earth, the Earth is moving along in its orbit. In order for the Moon to appear at the same phase <em>as viewed byan observer on Earth</em>it needs to travel slightly further than 360 degrees around the Earth and in order for it to be aligned such that there is a New Moon it takes about an extra 2 days.</p>

<p><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.sumanasinc.com/webcontent/animations/content/sidereal.html"> http://www.sumanasinc.com/webcontent/animations/content/sidereal.html</a> shows a nice animation demonstrating the difference between the orbital period of the Moon which defines the sidereal month (27.3 days) and the lunar phase cycle which defines the synodic month (29.5 days).</p>

<p>Observers on Earth see the same phase where ever they are positioned on Earth. However, the phases (apart from New Moon and Full Moon) look different to an observer in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. We in the Southern Hemisphere view the Moon "upside down". This is important to note because \(\text{99}\)% of all textbooks and online references include the Northern Hemisphere view of the phases and this is <em>not</em> what learners will see when they view the Moon for themselves. An awareness of this is crucial to reduce learner confusion when looking online and in generic textbooks.</p>

<p>The activity below is an optional extension activity which links the relative positions of the Earth, Sun and Moon to the phases of the Moon observed.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: H ands-on Moon Phases</strong></p>

<p>As the Moon revolves around the Earth, the side facing the Sun is always illuminated, just as Earth's daylight side is illuminated by the Sun. However, from the Earth's surface we do not see a half Moon lit up all the time. Instead, we see a change in the amount of the Moon which is lit up by the Sun.</p>

<p>In this activity learners will learn that the relative position of the Earth, Moon and Sun determine what phase of the Moon is observed. Learners will use a lamp to represent the Sun. The learners will represent the Earth and a styrofoam ball stuck on a pencil will represent the Moon. If you cannot get hold of a styrofoam ball then you can use an orange instead. They will vary the location of the Moon in its orbit around the Earth and observe the phase of the Moon. A dark room is needed for this activity. If necessary darken the classroom with bin bags or curtains. In the centre of the room place an unshaded lamp to represent the Sun.</p>

<p>Ideally learners should work in pairs for this activity, so that one learner can draw their observations while the other learner holds the ball in place. Ensure that learners hold the balls slightly above their heads so that they do not cast shadows over the ball. In this exercise we make the assumption that the Earth remains in the same spot while the Moon orbits around the Earth.</p>

<p>Before starting the activity, explain to learners the names of the Moon phases and draw them on the blackboard: New Moon (entirely dark), Full Moon (entirely lit), Crescent Moon (mostly dark), Gibbous Moon (mostly lit) and First Quarter Moon (left half lit) and Third Quarter Moon (right half lit). [Note that the first and third quarter appearances listed here are for the Southern Hemisphere only]</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>pencil (2 per pair)</li>
<li>one lamp that can shine in all directions (i.e., a lamp base with a bare 100 to 150 Watt bulb and no lampshade)</li>
<li>styrofoam balls (1 per pair)</li>
<li>black plastic bags (and tape) or curtains to darken the classroom</li>
<li>sheet of paper (1 per pair)</li>
</ul><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>You will work in pairs for this activity.</li>
<li>Place a lamp representing the Sun in the centre of the classroom. Even for a large classroom, you should only use one bright lamp placed in the middle of the classroom otherwise you will have shadowing effects that may ruin the results.</li>
<li>Darken the room if needed by taping dark plastic bags to the windows or closing the curtains.</li>
<li>Stick one of the pencils into your styrofoam ball so that you can hold the ball up by the pencil end. This ball represents the Moon.</li>
<li>All learners must stand in a circle around the central light, with your partner next to you in the circle. </li>
<li>Directly face the light in front of you. One of you should hold the ball at arms length, slightly above your head, and the other should hold the pencil and paper. The person holding the ball represents the Earth.</li>
<li>If you are holding the ball, move the ball from left to right (keeping still) and observe how much of it is lit by the light as you move it around. Now let your partner do the same.</li>
<li>Look at the different phases of the Moon drawn on the blackboard by your teacher (New Moon, Full Moon, First quarter, Third quarter).</li>
<li>One of you should now hold the ball and position it until from your point of view it looks completely in shadow. This represents New Moon.</li>
<li>The member of the pair not holding the ball should now draw the relative positions of the Sun, Moon and Earth, and write down the Moon phase corresponding to these positions.</li>
<li>Swap the person holding the ball and the pen/paper, and position the ball such that it is fully lit and looks like a Full Moon. The member of the pair not holding the ball should now write down the relative positions of the Sun, Moon and Earth.</li>
<li>Repeat this for all the phases listed in 8.</li>
<li>Look at the crescent Moon on the blackboard. Find out what positions you can place the ball in to see it lit up like a crescent (less than half lit).</li>
<li>Swap positions again and this time find out what positions you can place the ball in to see it lit up in a gibbous phase (more than half lit).</li>
</ol><p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>In what position do you need to place the Moon in order to see a New Moon?</li>
</ol><p><em>The Moon needs to be placed directly in between the Sun and the Earth.</em></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>In what position do you need to place the Moon in order to see a full Moon?</li>
</ol><p><em>The ball needs to be place d directly opposite from the Sun, with the Earth in between the two.</em></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>In what positions can you place the Moon in order to see a crescent?</li>
</ol><p><em>Any position as far as 90 degrees either side of the N ew Moon position (to the left or right).</em></p>

<p>Another optional activity that learners may complete in their own time is a month long Moon observation. They may have already completed this activity in Gr. 6 but it is included here in case you wish to conduct a Moon observation as an additional activity.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Month long Moon observation</strong></p>

<p>This activity can be conducted by students at home.The activity takes a month (30 days) to complete, therefore it can be done while other material is covered in class. Students may need reminding to complete their observations every day. Start the observations at New Moon so that the learners can follow the phases of the Moon in order. The dates of New Moon can be obtained online at http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/MoonPhase.php Once learners have completed all their observations you can discuss in class what they saw and ask them questions as to why they think the Moon changes its appearance.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Moon observation chart</li>
<li>pencil</li>
</ul><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Draw up an observation chart with blank circles to represent the moon each day.</li>
<li>Go out and observe the Moon. (You may have to do this during the day or during the night depending on when the Moon is visible).</li>
<li>Always stand in approximately the same spot and face the same direction (either south or north). Look from east to west and find the Moon.</li>
<li>Draw how the Moon looks by shading in the circles to reflect the shape of the Moon in your observation chart.</li>
<li>Note the date and time of your observation.</li>
</ol><p>Help: For example, if you can see the whole Moon, you do not need to shade in any part of the circle. If you can only see half of the Moon, shade the side of the Moon that you cannot see in the circle for that day. If you cannot see the Moon at all on a day, indicate this on your journal and also write down why you could not see the Moon.</p>

<p/>

<p>Before introducing the concept of gravity ensure that learners fully understand what is meant by a force (a push or a pull). Run through some everyday examples of forces that learners encounter such as pushing a trolley at the supermarket, or pushing or pulling their friends!</p>

<p>Strictly speaking when talking about "gravity" we are specifically referring to the gravitational force of attraction that occurs between the Earth (or another celestial body like a planet) and other objects, as opposed to the gravitational force in general which acts between any two objects with mass. For example, we would refer to the gravitational force acting to attract objects to the Moon as the Moon's gravity, but we would not generally refer to the gravitational force acting to attract things to ourselves as 'our gravity'.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>gravity</li>
<li>mass</li>
<li>weight</li>
<li>acceleration due to gravity</li>
<li>gravitational force</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The word <strong>gravity</strong> is used to describe the <strong>gravitational pull (force)</strong> an object experiences on or near the surface of a planet or moon. The gravitational force is a force that attracts objects with mass towards each other. <em>Any object with mass exerts a gravitational force on any other object with mass</em>. So, the Earth exerts a gravitational pull on you, the desks in your classroom and the chairs in your classroom, holding you on the surface and stopping you from drifting off into space.</p>

<p>The Earth's gravity pulls everything down towards the centre of the Earth and so when you drop an object like a book or an apple it falls to the ground. However, do you know that you, your desk, your chair, and the falling apple and book exert an equal but opposite pull on the Earth? Why do you think that these pulls don't cause the Earth to move noticeably?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The Earth has a much larger mass than a person or a desk and so it is accelerated by a much smaller amount even though the force exerted on the Earth by a desk is the same size as the force exerted on the desk by the Earth (just in opposite directions). This is why the Earth does not movecnoticeably.</p>

<p/>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0011.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The arrows show the direction of the force of gravity by the Earth on all other objects with mass. The arrows all point towards the centre of the Earth because the gravitational force is always attractive.</figcaption></figure><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>Interact with this simulation to see the relationship between gravity and the masses of the object and distance between them.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/gravity-force-lab/latest/gravity-force-lab_en.html"> http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/gravity-force-lab/latest/gravity-force-lab_en.html</a></p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The PhET simulation in the visit box can be used to very easily demonstrate how the gravitational force between two objects increases with mass and decreases as the distance between the objects increases. You can turn off the values, and use the position of the little figures tugging on the ropes to qualitatively demonstrate the relationships.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The gravitational force between two objects decreases as the objects move further apart. If you double the distance between two objects the gravitational force between them decreases by a factor of four. Similarly if you triple the distance between them, the gravitational force between them decreases by a factor of nine. This explains why we are stuck to the Earth rather than the Sun. The Sun is 333 000 times more massive than the Earth and its gravity is much stronger than the Earth's. However, we are so far away from the Sun that the gravitational force the Sun exerts on us, is much smaller than the gravitational force the Earth exerts on us.</p>

<p>The Moon is held in orbit around the Earth by the gravitational force between the Earth and the Moon. Similarly, the Sun's gravity holds the Earth in orbit around the Sun. Lets do an activity to demonstrate the Moon's orbit around the Earth.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Demonstrating the Moon's orbit around the Earth</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In this activity learners will demonstrate the orbit of the Moon around the Earth using a ball tied to a rope swung around their heads. They will demonstrate what would happen to the Moon if there were no gravity by letting go of the rope.</p>

<p><strong>Safety tip:</strong> Do this activity outside or in the school hall if possible so that learners can spread out. This will help them avoid hitting each other when the balls are released. If this is not possible take it in turns to do this demonstration or have only a few learners do this demonstration so that no one is hit by a flying ball!</p>

<p/>

<p>The content here on weight is not specified for Gr. 7 level in CAPS, and only appears in Gr. 9 in CAPS. However, as learners confuse mass and weight very easily, this has been included as enrichment material at this level. You can decide whether you want to cover this content with your learners or not. It is not to be assessed in Gr. 7.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The weight of an object is the force acting on it due to gravity. Weight is not the same as mass although the two words are often confused in everyday language.</p>

<p>The <strong>mass</strong> of an object is the amount of matter in the object, it tells you how many particles you have. Do you remember that we briefly spoke about atoms in Matter and Materials? So, for example, the mass of a wooden block tells us how many atoms there are. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and is independent of where you measure it. A wooden block with a mass of 10 kg on Earth also has a mass of 10 kg on the Moon.</p>

<p>However, an object's <strong>weight</strong> can change as it depends on the mass of the object and also the strength of gravity acting on it. Weight is measured in Newtons (N). For example the Earth exerts a gravitational force of about 10 Newtons for every kilogram of mass on its surface. So, a person with a mass of 50 kg has a weight of 500 N on the surface of the Earth.</p>

<p>The Moon also has its own gravity. The strength of gravity on the surface of the Moon is one-sixth that of the Earth, and so you would weigh one-sixth of what you do on Earth on the Moon. On Jupiter you would weigh 2.5 times more than you do on Earth as Jupiter's gravity is 2.5 times that of the Earth's. Even though you would weigh different amounts (and feel lighter on the Moon and heavier on Jupiter) your actual mass would stay the same in both cases.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0013.png" width="250"/><figcaption class="caption">An astronaut's mass remains the same wherever it is measured. The astronaut's weight however depends on where you measure it, as you can see the astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth but only 200 N on the Moon.</figcaption></figure><p>Answer the following questions to check your understanding of mass and weight:</p>

<p>In this activity, learners calculate what their weight would be on the seven other planets in our solar system. Although their mass remains the same, they will "feel" lighter or heavier because of the differences in the gravitational field strength on the surfaces of the other planets. You should emphasise that their mass always remains the same, but only their weight varies. If you do not have access to weighing scales you can either ask learners to estimate their mass or provide them with an example number.</p>

<p><strong>A note on falling objects</strong></p>

<p>A useful way to demonstrate the Earth's gravity is to look at falling objects. An optional extension activity is included below in which learners drop a variety of objects. You can take a vote from the class to see whether learners think that an apple or bag of sugar would hit the ground first. (Answer: they would hit the ground at the same time as long as air resistance is negligible.) It is very likely that learners will have the preconception that heavier items fall faster. It is not important at the moment that the learners answers are correct and do not try to lead them to the correct answer. They will hopefully discover it for themselves in the following experiment.</p>

<p><strong>Investigation: Dropping objects</strong></p>

<p>In this investigation learners need to work in pairs. They will initially drop a whole apple and half an apple from the same height at the same time. They will then further experiment with balls of different masses (but the same size) and balls of the same mass (but different volumes). It is very hard to drop objects at exactly the same time so that they hit the floor simultaneously so let the learners repeat the experiment several times until they are confident that they are dropping the objects at the same time. If it is hard for them to see which object hits the ground first, suggest to that learners they listen for the number of sounds they hear - one or two - when the objects hit. Learners might need to repeat this investigation many times since it most likely contradicts their preconceptions! Safety tip: It is probably a good idea to have the apples cut in half ahead of time.</p>

<p>Once the learners have finished their experiment you can demonstrate the effects of air resistance by dropping a hammer and a feather. Have the learners take a vote on what will happen when you drop the hammer and feather. Be ready to explain to learners that air resistance slows the fall of the feather and that if there were no air resistance the two would fall at the same rate and hit the floor at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>INVESTIGATIVE QUESTION:</strong> Do different objects fall at the same rate?</p>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong></p>

<p>What do you think will happen?</p>

<p>What are you keeping constant in this experiment?</p>

<p><em>The height at which objects are dropped.</em></p>

<p>What are you changing in this experiment?</p>

<p><em>The type objects that are being dropped, in particular the mass and volume of the objects.</em></p>

<p>How reliable was your experiment? How could you improve your method?</p>

<p><em>Learner dependent answer. Example answers could include: It is difficult to drop objects at exactly the same time. It would be better to drop the objects from a greater height. Air resistance could have affected the results and it would be better to drop the objects in a vacuum.</em></p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong></p>

<p>Learners should have found that the apple and half apple hit the floor at the same time. They should also have found that the balls of the same mass hit the floor at the same time and also the balls of the same volume hit the floor at the same time. From this they should conclude that all objects dropped, fall at the same rate no matter what their shape or size if air resistance can be ignored. (Advanced: they <em>accelerate</em> at the same rate). In the case of the hammer and feather drop, learners should have found that the hammer landed first. This is because of the effects of air resistance slowing the feather's fall.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Which landed first, the apple or the half apple?</li>
</ol><p><em>They should have both landed at the same (or close to the same) time.</em></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Considering the balls of the same mass, which landed first, the larger one or the smaller one?</li>
</ol><p><em>They should have both landed at the same time.</em></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Considering the balls of the same volume, which landed first, the heavier one or the lighter one?</li>
</ol><p><em>They should have both landed at the same time.</em></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Why do you think the two balls dropped always landed at the same time?</li>
</ol><p><em>In an ideal situation, all objects dropped from the same height will land at the same time, this is because the Earth's gravity causes the same acceleration for everything no matter how heavy it is or its volume.</em></p>

<p><strong>Advanced Teacher Note:</strong> According to the universal law of gravitation, the Earth's gravitational force pulls down on an object with a force that is proportional to the (gravitational) mass of the object and the (gravitational) mass of the Earth. In all cases the mass of the Earth is the same and so any differences in the gravitational force depends only upon the difference in the gravitational mass of the objects being dropped.</p>

<p>According to Newton's second law, the force exerted on an object, F, is given by F=ma where m is the inertial mass of the object and a is the acceleration produced by the force F. All objects resist movement when acted on by a force. This resistance is called inertia and arises because an object has (inertial) mass.</p>

<p>When dropped, a heavier object experiences a greater gravitational force as it has a greater (gravitational) mass, but also resists harder as well as its inertial mass is larger. Lighter objects experience a smaller gravitational force and a smaller inertia.</p>

<p>We have, Force=mia = mgg where g is independent of the falling object, where mi= inertial mass and mg = gravitational mass.</p>

<p>So the resulting acceleration an object experiences is given by a = (mg/mi) x g</p>

<p>As the value of g is independent of the falling object, the acceleration is given by the ratio of the gravitational and inertial masses. It turns out that the measured acceleration of all objects in the Earth's gravitational field is the same, they all fall at the same rate. This implies that the ratio between the gravitational mass and inertial mass is the same for all objects. By setting the value of G, the gravitational constant appropriately we can set the two masses equal to each other, a rather remarkable result since the gravitational mass is what causes the object to accelerate and the inertial mass opposes the acceleration!</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Why do you think that the hammer landed before the feather?</li>
</ol><p><em>In a real situation, the air around us affects how objects fall. As an object moves through the air, it must push the air out of the way, it experiences air resistance. The feather is much lighter than the hammer and so the effect of air resistance is much larger for the feather. The net force acting downwards on a falling object is the force due to gravity - force due to air resistance. As the feather is much lighter than the hammer, the net force acting on it will be less and so it will experience a smaller acceleration towards the ground and fall more slowly.</em></p>

<p><strong>Advanced Teacher Note:</strong> Air resistance is a drag force acting to slow the object down. The size of the force depends upon the velocity of the falling object squared, the surface area of the falling object and the density of the fluid it is falling in (in this case air). Very light objects are slowed by air resistance, like feathers or thin sheets of paper. This is because their weight is very small compared with the air resistance. Very large objects are also slowed by air resistance. This explains why a parachute slows your fall. Before you open a parachute only a small amount of air needs to be pushed out of the way as you fall. After opening, the wide parachute must push much more air out of the way and the air resistance increases, slowing you down.</p>

<p><strong>A note on Weightlessness</strong></p>

<p>The term weightless causes a lot of confusion for learners. The confusion of a person's actual weight with one's feeling of weight is the source of many misconceptions. Weightlessness refers only to someone's sensation of their weight, or lack thereof. Weightlessness is a feeling experienced by someone when there are no external objects touching the person exerting a push or pull upon them, (we call these contact forces because they arise due to things being in contact or touching each other).</p>

<p>The weight of a person is the force of gravitational attraction to the Earth, which that person experiences. Someone in free fall, feels weightless but they have not lost their weight, they are still experiencing the Earth's gravitational attraction.</p>

<p>Learners are also often confused as to why astronauts in orbit around the Earth float in their spacecraft. One common misconception is that there is no gravity in space and so the astronauts can float. In actual fact, in low Earth orbit the Earth's gravity is about \(\text{90}\)% of its strength at the surface of Earth. The only reason the astronauts float is because they are in free fall and their spacecraft is also in free fall with them, falling at the same rate. Therefore, the astronauts appear to float when compared with the spacecraft because they are both falling at the same rate. Another example is how orbiting spacecraft are essentially in free fall as there is 'nothing' retarding their motion towards to centre of the Earth, but because of their orbital velocity, they never actually move closer to the Earth.</p>

<p>A useful link to a video of someone experiencing free fall is given below:</p>

<p>Watch Felix Baumbartner's skydive. He experienced free-fall or weightlessness. <a data-class="ExternalLink" href=""> </a></p>

<p>As you have already discovered, the Moon, like any other planet or moon, has its own gravity. The strength of gravity on the surface of the Moon is one-sixth that of the Earth, and so on the Moon you would weigh one-sixth of what you do on Earth. Due to the weak gravity on the Moon, you would be able to jump six times higher than usual! The astronauts had to learn to walk in strange ways (such as leaping or hopping) to move about on the surface of the Moon.</p>

<p/>

<p>Learners are often confused about the differences between waves and tides. Waves on the surface of the oceans, seas or lakes are caused by the wind and are independent of tides. Tides cause the overall water level to change with time. At high tide the sea is really high up on the beach, at low tide it is really far out. The water level gradually changes between the two and the cycle repeats daily with two high tides and two low tides at a given point in 24 hours. A tidal wave, or tsunami, is caused by a sudden disturbance, such as an earthquake and is unrelated to tides.</p>

<p/>

<li>tidal bulge</li>
<li>spring tides</li>
<li>neap tides</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Tides are the predictable, repeated rise and fall of sea levels on Earth. If you look closely you will notice that the height of the surf at any beach varies slowly with time. When the sea is far out and there is lots of sand exposed, it is called low tide. You can see an example of low tide in the photo.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0015.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">At low tide, the water is far out and the boats are resting on the sand.</figcaption></figure><p>Following low tide, the water gradually comes further up on the beach until it reaches its highest level, this is called high tide. After high tide the water level gradually drops again until it goes back to low tide. This pattern repeats over and over again. You can see an example of low and high tide at the same beach in the pictures below.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0016.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The same beach photographed at low tide (top) and high tide (bottom).</figcaption></figure><p>In general there are are two low and two high tides per day on the sea, which can be observed on the beaches or even in estuaries. The times of high and low tides are not exactly the same every day, they occur roughly one hour later each day.</p>

<p>Tides can be predicted and low and high tide times are published in tide tables. Fishermen use this information to plan when they will fish. Surfers also use this information so they can plan the best times to go surfing as each beach has a particular time when the sea level is just right for producing excellent surfing waves.</p>

<p>So you now know that all seas have tides, why do you think this is? Lets do an activity to find out.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Ask learners to give you their answer as to what causes the tides. You can write down all the answers. At this point it does not matter if the learners do not know what causes the tides, they will find out in the "Dance with the tides" activity. Once they have completed the activity, ask the learners again to see if they have changed their minds. At this point they should be aware that the gravitational pulls of the Moon and the Sun cause the tides.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Dance of the tides</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This activity requires learners to work in groups of six. One learner will represent the Earth, four learners will represent the Earth's oceans and one learner will represent the Moon. You could ask learners to wear coloured T-shirts (green for the Earth, blue for the oceans, grey for the Moon) or to pin drawings or photos of the object they are representing to their school shirts with safety pins to make it clear what they are representing.</p>

<p>In this activity learners will model how the Moon's gravitational pull causes tides on Earth. Be sure to explain to them that the scale of the model is not correct, for example the Moon and Earth sizes are not correct in relation to each other. You can ask learners how they think the Moon can influence the Earth. Explain that moons and planets can influence each other's spins and tilts from a distance via their gravitational pull. All objects that have mass have their own gravity, but only large objects, like planets, have enough gravity to influence each other from very large distances. Explain that you are going to model what effect the Moon's gravitational pull has on the Earth. Remember that the gravitational force exerted by an object diminishes as you go further from it. Therefore, objects that are closer to the Moon experience a greater gravitational pull towards the Moon than objects that are further away.</p>

<p>If there were no Moon, would we still have tides?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Yes but the difference between high and low tide would not be as extreme. Since the Sun is so far away, the Sun's gravitational pull would give the tides only a third of their height.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In this activity we have ignored the motion of the Moon revolving around the Earth. The time of high tide changes each day because the Moon is moving around the Earth. If we had no Moon, the tide due to the Sun alone would occur at essentially the same time every day. This activity also ignores the friction between the water and solid Earth as it spins, which causes the tidal bulges (piled up ocean bulges) to lie ahead of the Earth-Moon line in the direction of the Earth's rotation.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Look at the image below. It shows how the Moon's gravity distorts the shape of the Earth's oceans into an oval shape. Do you remember how the gravitational force depends on distance? The ocean on the side of the Earth closest to the Moon experiences a greater gravitational pull towards the Moon relative to the ocean on the far side of the Earth. This difference in gravitational pulls stretches the Earth's oceans into an oval shape. Along the Earth-Moon direction the oceans form two <em>tidal bulges</em>. At places in line with the Moon, where the oceans are experiencing a tidal bulge we have high tide. At locations which are at right angles to the Moon we have low tide.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0022.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">This picture shows the Earth and the Moon looking down from above. The gravitational pull experienced by different parts of the Earth towards the Moon are shown as arrows. The longer the arrow, the greater the pull. The ocean closest to the Moon experiences the greatest pull from the Moon and the ocean farthest from the Moon experiences the smallest pull towards the Moon. The differences result in the Earth's oceans being stretched to an oval shape.</figcaption></figure><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>As well as distorting the shape of the Earth's oceans, the Moon's gravitational pull also distorts the shape of the solid Earth. The solid Earth's bulge is about one hundred times smaller than the ocean bulge, but the Earth's crust closest to the Moon actually rises a few centimetres!</p>
</div><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The highest tides in the world are at the Bay of Fundy in Canada. The bay is very narrow, so water rushing in from the ocean can rise and fall by up to 20 metres a day!</p>
</div>
<p>Why do you think there are two low tides and two high tides at a given beach per day? Look at the diagram above again. When the Moon is directly overhead your location you experience high tide. You also experience high tide when the Moon is directly opposite your location on Earth. Remember that the Earth spins on its axis once every 24 hours and so during one day you experience two high tides at a given location: one when the Moon is directly above your location and one when the Moon is directly opposite your location roughly twelve hours later. Similarly there are two low tides per day. This cycle continues as the Earth spins.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The actual times of low and high tides at a particular place on Earth are influenced not only by the Earth's spin but also by the Moon's motion around the Earth in its orbit. As the Earth spins, the Moon also travels around the Earth. The Moon rises about an hour later each day, and high (and low) tides also occur roughly an hour later each day.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The height of the tides varies slightly with the phase of the Moon. This is <em>not</em> because the gravitational pull of the Moon is changing: the Moon has the same amount of mass and therefore exerts the same gravitational pull at all phases. Rather, the change in the heights is due to the relative alignment of the Sun and the Moon. Let's look at this further in the following activity.</p>

<p>When the Sun, Moon, and Earth are lined up in a straight line (at the time of New or Full Moon), the pull of the Sun's gravity adds to the pull of the Moon's gravity creating extra-high high tides, and very low low tides. The difference in height between low and high tide is at its maximum at this time. These are called <em>spring tides</em>. When the Sun and Moon are at right angles to each other (during first and third quarter), the Sun's gravitational pull partially cancels out the Moon's gravitational pull and produces less extreme tides. The difference in height between the low and high tide is at its minimum at this time. These are called <em>neap tides</em>. Overall the Moon contribution to the Earth's tides is bigger than the Sun's contribution because it is much closer to Earth. If there were no Moon, the Earth's tides would be about a third of their current height.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Some additional activities are explained below.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Tides Poster</strong></p>

<p>In this art and craft activity learners will make a poster to show the relative positions of the Sun and Moon producing spring and neap tides. You can use whatever art materials you have available, e.g. paint or pencils/crayons or felt pens. Ensure that you have blue, yellow and white and black colours so that the Earth's oceans, Sun and Moon can be accurately represented. Ensure that learners correctly identify which Earth-Moon-Sun alignments and Moon phases cause spring and neap tides . Ensure that learners draw the tidal bulge in the correct orientation and that the heights of their spring tides are higher at high tide and lower at low tide than their neap counterparts. Ensure that they correctly label places on Earth experiencing high and low tide.</p>

<li>Label where high and low tide occur.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Activity: Make a tide wheel</strong></p>

<p>This is a very simple and fun activity for learners where they make a tide wheel using a template. Internet access and access to a printer is needed for this activity. The template used in the activity can be freely downloaded from the US weather service website at</p>

<p><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/ocean/images/tidewheel_w.pdf"> http://www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/ocean/images/tidewheel_w.pdf</a></p>

<p>The template file contains two pages. If available print out the template file onto thin card, this will make the tide wheel sturdier, however normal A4 paper is also fine (the learners will have to be careful not to rip the paper in this case). The printed pages will have to be secured together in the middle using a brass fastener (sometimes called a split pin). These are available from stationary stores.</p>

</div>
<p>[Did you know] The Moon's orbit is gradually increasing, and the Moon is slowly moving away from the Earth. Due to this the tides used to be much higher than they are today, and they will continue to become smaller.</p>

<p>You can now see how important our closest neighbour the Moon is. The Moon's gravitational pull is responsible for the ocean tides!</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-6">The effects of tides on shoreline ecosystems</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This section covers the effects that the tides have on marine life living in the region between low and high tide: the intertidal zone. This is a particularly harsh environment for marine animals and many have developed unique adaptations to help them thrive in their shoreline environments. A good way to introduce this topic is to ask learners about their experiences at the beach, in particular in rocky pool areas. You could ask them what sort of marine life they have seen for themselves in these areas. If learners have not visited the beach themselves you can also show colourful photographs of marine life found in the intertidal zone and explain how different animals have adapted to live in the shoreline environment.</p>

<p>This section links nicely with the biodiversity areas of the Life and Living strand in Gr. 7 and in particular with the Interactions and interdependence within the environment section of the Life and Living strand in Gr. 8. A class visit to an aquarium would be an ideal excursion for this section, allowing learners to see for themselves the organisms and conditions described in this section.</p>

</div><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>ecosystem</li>
<li>intertidal zone</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The region of the beach between high tide and low tide levels is called the <strong>intertidal zone</strong><em>.</em> The intertidal zone is a harsh environment for marine animals to live. During storms the surf can be very rough and plants and animals must be able to withstand the battering from big waves and not get washed away! Animals and plants that live here are underwater at high tide but are exposed to the air during low tide. Some organisms may stay underwater if they are in small rock pools which do not empty out when the tide goes out. Those that are exposed to air at low tide, face hot temperatures in summer and cold temperatures in winter so they must be able to adapt to different temperatures.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0026.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The intertidal zone can be seen here between the sea and the top of the sand.</figcaption></figure><p>Animals exposed to the air at low tide may be soaked in fresh water when it rains and yet be soaked in salty sea water at high tide. Therefore, they must also be able to adapt to different salt concentrations as the tides come in and out.</p>

<p>Different animals have adapted to this tough environment in different ways. For example:</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0027.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Crabs burrow into the sand to hide during low tide.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0028.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Kelp and other seaweeds are covered with thick slime to prevent them drying out.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0029.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Mussels and barnacles close their shells tightly to avoid drying out.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr7eb02-gd-0030.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">This oystercatcher takes advantage of low tide to feed.</figcaption></figure><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">The effects of tides on shoreline ecosystems</h1><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>Learners can use any of the examples given in this activity or those that they have read about.

<p/>
</div>

<p>High up in the intertidal zone water splashes only during high tide and the rest of the time it is dry. As you go lower down the intertidal zone, down the beach towards the sea, it gets progressively wetter for longer periods of time.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Some extra information about the different animals found in different areas in the intertidal zone:</p>

<p>High up in the intertidal zone (closer to the beach) the area is pounded by strong waves. Animals that live here need to be able to cling tightly to rocks to avoid being swept out to sea. Barnacles, limpets, periwinkles, and whelks cling tightly to rocks to avoid being swept out to sea. Seals and sea otters either rest or sleep above the intertidal zone so that they are not washed away or hit by the waves. If the tide comes in really high, they will move to another shoreline.</p>

<p>In the middle of the intertidal zone, tide pools often form and animals come to the tide pools to feed. Animals that live here can have softer bodies as this region is not so heavily pounded with waves. Sea anemones, snails, hermit crabs and starfish live in tidal pools.</p>

<p>In the lowest region of the intertidal zone where it is mainly wet, organisms are not well adapted to long periods of dryness. Some of the creatures found here are sea anemones, brown seaweed, crabs, green algae, limpets, mussels, sea slugs, starfish, sea urchins, shrimp, snails and sponges.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Marine life in the intertidal zone have to adapt to the rise and fall of sea levels at the beach. But marine life is not the only kind of life that has to take note of the tides. Many people also use the low tide to collect seaweed. Seaweed has many uses, including being a food source for people. In some cultures seaweed is used for medicinal purposes and to make various woven products, such as rope, baskets and mats.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">How good a fisherman are you?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In this activity learners have to use a tide table to predict the best fishing times in Durban on a particular day. This emphasises how learning about the tides in the classroom has real world applications.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>

<p>Fish are easier to catch at times when they are feeding. The tides determine when most fish feed. When the tide is coming in or going out the moving water stimulates feeding. The fastest part of the tide is normally around two hours before and after low and high tides. These times are the best times to go fishing.</p>

<p>If you were to stand on the surface of the Moon you would experience only 1/6th the strength of gravity that you experience standing on the surface of the Earth. Why is this? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>This is because the Moon is less massive that the Earth and so it has less gravity.</p>

<p>Look at the following photo of boats on the sand. Do you think it is a problem that they are stuck on the sand? How will people get them into the sea?</p>

<p/><p/>

        
<p>It is not a problem as it is low tide at the moment so the water has receded and the boats rest on the sand. But, when it is high tide again the water will come up and lift the boats off the sand and people will be able to get them out to sea.</p>

<p>Explain why spring tides are more extreme than neap tides. [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>When the Sun, Moon, and Earth are lined up in a straight line the pull of the Sun's gravity adds to the pull of the Moon's gravity creating spring tides. When the Sun and Moon are at right angles to each other the Sun's gravitational pull partially cancels out the Moon's gravitational pull and produces less extreme tides. These are called neap tides.</p>
