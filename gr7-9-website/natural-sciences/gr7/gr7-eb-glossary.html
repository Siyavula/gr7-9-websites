<p><strong>acceleration due to gravity:</strong> the acceleration given to an object by the attractive gravitational force of the Earth or other celestial body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>gravitational force:</strong> the force that attracts an object with mass towards another object with mass</p>

<p><strong>ecosystem:</strong> a community of living organisms and their interaction with the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>intertidal zone:</strong> an area that is above water at low tide and under water at high tide (i.e. lies between low and high tide levels)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tides:</strong> the regular rise and fall of the oceans (and some rivers and lakes) twice per day caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and to a lesser extent the Sun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tidal bulge:</strong> a swell in the sea level in line with the Moon on either side of the Earth (along the Earth-Moon line)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>spring tides:</strong> extreme tides with the maximum difference between low and high tides which occur when the Earth, Moon and Sun are in alignment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>neap tides:</strong> tides with the minimum difference between low and high tides which occur when the Moon and Sun are at right angles to each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>sphere:</strong> any round object that has a surface that is the same distance from its centre at all points, for example, a ball or globe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>axis:</strong> a real or imaginary straight line about which something turns; the imaginary axis of the Earth passes through the North and South Pole</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>indirect:</strong> not direct, by a longer way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>equator:</strong> an imaginary horizontal line around the middle of the Earth, at an equal distance from the North Pole and the South Pole</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>equinox:</strong> occurs twice a year (around 20 March and 22 September) when the Sun's rays fall directly on the Earth's equator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>hemisphere:</strong> one half of a sphere or globe; the Earth is divided at the equator into the Northern and Southern hemispheres</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>tilt:</strong> to slant or tip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>season:</strong> each of the four divisions of the year (spring, summer, autumn, winter) which have different weather patterns and daylight hours</p>
</li>
