      <p/><ul data-class="ListBulleted" class="glossary"><li><strong>absorb:</strong> to take in</li>
<li><strong>biofuel:</strong> a fuel made from biological materials such as soya, maize or sugar cane; examples of these fuels are biodiesel and methanol</li>
<li><strong>conduction:</strong> the transfer of energy between objects that are in direct contact with each other</li>
<li><strong>conductor:</strong> a substance which allows heat, sound or electric charge to pass through it easily; a good conductor alls free passage whilst a poor conductor allows partial passage</li>
<li><strong>conservation:</strong> a quantity stays constant; something is not lost or destroyed</li>
<li><strong>conserve:</strong> to make something last longer by using it carefully</li>
<li><strong>consistent:</strong> reliable and predictable</li>
<li><strong>consumption:</strong> using up a resource</li>
<li><strong>convection current:</strong> the movement of liquid and gas particles as the substance warms up and rises and then cools and moves down again to form a current</li>
<li><strong>convection:</strong> transfer of energy through a liquid or gas by the movement of liquid or gas particles</li>
<li><strong>dynamo:</strong> a small generator that can be used for powering a bicycle light, a mine helmet or a wind up torch</li>
<li><strong>fossil fuel:</strong> non-renewable energy sources, namely coal, oil and natural gas</li>
<li><strong>generator:</strong> a machine used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy</li>
<li><strong>geyser:</strong> a cylindrical tank that is used to warm and store hot water</li>
<li><strong>greenhouse gases:</strong> gases in the atmosphere that contribute to the greenhouse effect; these gases include carbon dioxide and methane</li>
<li><strong>heat:</strong> heat is the energy transferred between two objects as a result of the temperature difference between them; it is also when energy is transferred between a system and the environment as a result of the temperature difference between them; it is measured in joules (J).</li>
<li><strong>hydrocarbon:</strong> a molecule which consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms bonded together</li>
<li><strong>hydropower:</strong> the energy harnessed from a moving water source, like a river or a waterfall</li>
<li><strong>input:</strong> something that enters a system and is altered by the system to produce an output</li>
<li><strong>insulator:</strong> a substance which resists the movement of heat, sound or electric charge through it</li>
<li><strong>joule:</strong> the standard, international unit of measurement for energy</li>
<li><strong>kinetic energy:</strong> energy that a body has when it is moving</li>
<li><strong>law:</strong> in science, a law is a statement of what happens and it is based on repeated experiments and observations</li>
<li><strong>matt:</strong> not glossy or shiny</li>
<li><strong>methane:</strong> a colourless, odourless gas which is often called natural gas</li>
<li><strong>national electricity grid:</strong> the network of cables, pylons and transformers which transfer electricity throughout the country</li>
<li><strong>non-renewable:</strong> a resource, such as coal, that can not be replenished or there is a limited supply of it</li>
<li><strong>nuclear:</strong> the type of energy released when a large atomic nucleus breaks up or two smaller ones combine</li>
<li><strong>output:</strong> the end result of a process</li>
<li><strong>potential energy:</strong> energy that is stored in a system</li>
<li><strong>pylon:</strong> a large vertical steel tower which supports electrical power cables</li>
<li><strong>radiation:</strong> the transfer of energy from a source that does not require physical contact or movement of particles</li>
<li><strong>reflect:</strong> to throw back heat light or sound without absorbing it</li>
<li><strong>renewable:</strong> something which is continuously replenished or there is an unlimited supply of it</li>
<li><strong>reservoir:</strong> a large container or space in which a gas or liquid can be stored</li>
<li><strong>Sankey diagram:</strong> a Sankey diagram is used to show the difference between input and output energy</li>
<li><strong>solenoid:</strong> a current carrying coil or coils of conducting wire</li>
<li><strong>system:</strong> a system is any set of parts working together to carry out a particular function</li>
<li><strong>temperature:</strong> a measure of how hot or cold a substance feels; it is measured in degrees Celsius (oC).</li>
<li><strong>theory:</strong> in science, a theory is an explanation of why or how something happens</li>
<li><strong>thermal:</strong> relating to heat</li>
<li><strong>transfer:</strong> to move from one object or place to another; in an energy system, we say energy is transferred from one object to another</li>
<li><strong>transformer:</strong> an electrical device to transfer energy between two parts of the circuit in the national electricity grid</li>
<li><strong>turbine:</strong> a set of curved blades on a central, rotating spire</li>
