<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>This is the first time learners are introduced to acids and bases. The approach is to start from the known and introduce the topic through learner's experiences with everyday acids and bases. We will also first look at how we experience acids and bases in foods. This links to Life and Living and the senses. We will then look at acids and bases in the laboratory and the basic properties of acids, bases and neutrals. They will look at acids and bases again in Gr. 9 in more detail, also covering the pH scale, and the reactions of acids and bases.</p>

<p>What do you know about acids? Would you touch an acid? Have you ever tasted an acid? Do you think it is possible to taste an acid without burning your tongue? What do you think it would feel like when an acid burned your tongue?</p>

<p/>

<p>Before we talk more about acids, let us first examine the human tongue. It is a most fascinating organ, and plays an important role in our sense of taste.</p>

<p>What is your favourite food? What do you like most about your favourite food? You will probably say that you just LOVE the taste of it! The taste of our favourite foods make us feel good. How do we taste our food?</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0001.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">We taste food with tiny structures on our tongues!</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Look in the mirror, and stick out your tongue. Look for small, round bumps. These are called <strong>papillae</strong>. Most of them contain <strong>taste buds</strong>. The taste buds are very small structures which have sensitive hairs. The chemicals in the food that you eat dissolve into your saliva in solution. The chemicals then stimulate the tiny hairs within the tastebuds and turn these signals into impulses. These impulses travel to the brain allowing us to experience the sensation of taste.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Insects have the most highly developed sense of taste. They have taste organs on their feet, antennae, and mouthparts.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners will study the nervous system in more detail in Gr. 9 Life and Living, as well as in Life Sciences if they carry on with the subject in Gr. 10. For now, this is just interesting information about how we taste foods and distinguish between different tastes.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>We have more than 10 000 taste buds in our mouth. You even have taste buds on the roof of your mouth.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Have a look at your own tongue</h1>
<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>As a homework exercise, learners can do the following activity. Otherwise, if you have some mirrors available in the classroom, learners can have a look at their tongues. If you do this in class, try bringing some lemons to class for learners to taste and then describe their experiences.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Close your eyes and imagine biting into a slice of lemon. Can you describe the experience? What does the lemon taste like? Sweet, sour, salty or bitter? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Sour</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>If you have sugar solution and lemon juice available in the class, taste these different substances. See if you can identify <em>where</em> on your tongue you taste the two different tastes.</p>

<p/>
</div>

<p/>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">Your tongue can only sense four flavours</h3>
<p/>

<p>You can only sense four different tastes with your tongue. Can you name them? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Sweet, sour, bitter and salt.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0003.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The tongue map.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>The four main tastes that are most common, are sweet, sour, salt and bitter. These tastes combine to make up the different flavours of our foods.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>A flavour is a combination of tastes and smells.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0004.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">How would you classify the taste of apples? Sweet or sour? Bitter? Perhaps a combination?</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0005.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Many people really enjoy the sour-salty taste of salt and vinegar chips!</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>There is a good reason for why we like certain tastes, but not others.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Our sense of taste protects us</h3>
<p/>

<p>Just as we like and seek out foods that taste good, our bodies have also been programmed to avoid food with strong bitter or sour tastes. This helps to protect us against poisons, which often have a strong bitter taste. 'Bitter' is also the basic taste that our tongues are most sensitive to. Spoiled food often tastes sour and it may also have a bad smell. Our instinct will be to avoid it, which will protect us from becoming ill from ingesting the organisms that have spoiled the food.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Almond nuts can be sweet or bitter, depending on the type of tree they come from. The sweet almonds (which we eat) do not contain poisonous chemicals. Bitter almonds from another tree species contain chemicals which are toxic to humans.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0006.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Sweet almonds, such as these, are edible as they do not contain toxic chemicals, unlike the wild bitter almonds.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0007.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelsgalpert/3681442211/in/photostream/"/><figcaption class="caption">Cocoa beans come from cocoa pods.

<p>In the previous section you had to imagine what it would feel like if an acid burned your tongue. In the next section we are going to learn more about acids. We will learn that they taste sour (and also why it is not a good idea to taste them!).</p>

<p/>

<p>We will also learn about other substances that have a special relationship with acids. They are called bases. Finally, we will also learn about substances that are neither acids or bases, but neutral substances.</p>

<p>Do you know the names of any acids? Think about this as a class and make a list of all the acid names you have heard. </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>You can do this on the board and ask learners for their answers to write down. Some examples might be vinegar (which contains acetic acid), citric acid (found in citrus fruits such as lemons, oranges and grapefruit), ascorbic acid (also known as Vitamin C, which comes in tablets, capsules or chewable sweets, and it occurs naturally in citrus fruit, tomatoes, strawberries), tartaric acid, etc).</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>There are many different acids. You might have already tasted an acid in class. Was it the sugar water or the lemon juice?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Ask your learners these questions. The answers are: The lemon juice contains an acid. The lemon juice was sour. <strong>Encourage learners to write in their workbooks and make notes in the margins and empty spaces!</strong> They should not be afraid of scribbling and taking notes during class whilst you are talking or explaining a concept. Taking notes is a very important skill to learn.</p>

<p>All acids taste sour. Does this mean that all acids are safe to taste? Definitely NOT! Next, we will learn which acids should not be tasted under any circumstances.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The word acid comes from the Latin word <em>acidus</em>, meaning 'sour'.</p>

<p>Some acids are very dangerous and must be handled carefully. These acids are <strong>corrosive</strong>. They can cause serious burns on your skin. Scientists always wear protective clothing when handling these acids. It would be very dangerous to taste them. These acids are most often found and used in laboratories and certain industrial processes. We will refer to them as laboratory acids.</p>

<p>The following table contains the names and <strong>chemical formulae</strong> of the three most common laboratory acids. Even though you have not learnt how to write chemical formulae yet, we have included them here. You should handle containers with these formulae printed on them with care.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners will only study chemical formulae in detail in Gr. 9 Matter and Materials, however, this is a good opportunity to introduce them to the concept especially so that learners are able to recognise dangerous chemical substances.</p>

<p>Other acids in the foods we eat are not dangerous. In fact, some are even vital for our health and well-being. Let's now have a look at acids that are safe to handle.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Natural and household acids</h4>
<p/>

<p>Not all acids are dangerous. One such acid is called ascorbic acid, or vitamin C. Vitamin C helps our immune system. Which foods contain vitamin C? Have a look at the pictures.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Most people associate oranges with a high vitamin C content, but there are other foods which are much higher in vitamin C. These include chillies, guavas, strawberries, bell peppers, broccoli, kiwi fruits and papaya.</p>

<p/>

<p>We will call the acids that we find in food natural acids. Many of these natural acids are found in the kitchen. For this reason they are also sometimes called household acids.</p>

<p/>

<p>One very well-known household acid is acetic acid. Vinegar is a mixture of a small amount of acetic acid dissolved in water. So vinegar is a solution of acetic acid in water.</p>

<p>Many of the fizzy drinks that we drink contain carbonic acid.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Do you think that it would be possible for acids to lose their strength? There is one class of compounds that can make acids lose their strength. These compounds are called bases.</p></div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-6">Bases</h3><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>base</li>
<li>neutral substance</li>
<li>neutralise</li>
<li>alkali</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>Bases can <strong>neutralise</strong> acids and vice versa. What does it mean to neutralise something? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>At this level, learners can think of neutralisation as a process in which something potent (and potentially harmful) is changed into something harmless (or at least less harmful). Later on (in Gr. 9) they will learn the proper scientific definition of neutralisation: "the process in which an acid reacts with a base to form a salt and water". It is important to note that a neutralisation reaction <strong>does not</strong> necessarily result in a neutral solution.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>When an acid and a base are mixed together in the<strong>correct ratio</strong>, they will neutralise each other. This means that the solution made up of the acid and the base becomes something that is neither an acid nor a base, but neutral. In the process, both the acid and the base will lose their unique characteristics.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Bases and acids have chemical properties that are the opposite of each other. We can think of bases as the chemical opposite of acids.</p>

<p/>

<p>As with acids, there are some bases that are extremely dangerous. The same hazard symbol that is used to warn people of the dangers of acids, is also used for these bases. Strong bases react corrosively with other materials and can burn your skin. They must be handled carefully and always while wearing appropriate protective clothing, such as lab coats, gloves and safety glasses.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0019.jpg" width="300" alt="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sodium\_hydroxide\_solution.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">Sodium hydroxide is a strong base used in laboratories. Do you see the yellow corrosive warning symbol? <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sodium_hydroxide_solution.jpg"> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sodium_hydroxide_solution.jpg </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Other bases are mild enough to be used as cleaning materials in and around the home. This does not mean that they are completely harmless. It just means that they have been mixed with other substances so that they are not so corrosive.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Acids and bases in our homes</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>For this activity, learners must first identify the products in the photograph provided. All of these household products contain bases.

<p>The bases will be easy to describe as they mostly feel quite slippery between the fingers. Acids generally leave a "rough" feeling on the skin and are not slippery like bases.</p>

<p/><p>Many acids and bases are dangerous to touch or taste - they are corrosive.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Bases that can dissolve in water are called<strong>alkalis</strong>. For this reason, the terms base and alkali are sometimes considered to have the same meaning. (Words that have the same meaning are called synonyms.)</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Finally, there is a class of substances that are neither acids nor bases. They are called <strong>neutral</strong> substances. We will explore them next.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-7">Neutral substances</h3>
<p/>

<p>We have learnt that when an acid and a base are mixed (in the right amounts), they will neutralise each other. That means that, together, they will change into something that is neither an acid nor a base. So the acid will lose its properties and so will the base. And the new substance that forms from the two substances will be neither an acid nor a base. We call it a neutral substance.</p>

<p/>

<p>Some neutral substances are formed when an acid is mixed with a base and a neutralisation reaction occurs. Other substances are neutral to begin with. They are not the product of a neutralisation reaction. The neutral substances that are the most well known are: water, table salt, sugar solution and cooking oil.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0021.jpg" width="250"/><figcaption class="caption">Cooking oil is a neutral substance.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>We have learnt about three classes of substances: acids, bases and neutral substances. But, we cannot tell whether a substance is an acid, base, or a neutral substance, just by looking at it. We know that acids taste sour, but we have also learnt that it is never a good idea to taste chemicals.</p>

<p/>

<p>Let's imagine we have an unknown substance. It is colourless and looks just like water. It is also odourless (that means it has no smell). There are no physical signs to show whether it is acidic, basic, or neutral. How can we tell what it is?</p>

<p>It has been noted that some household indicators that appear on the list above are not very effective, such as tea and beetroot. Some are more sensitive, including curry powder and turmeric.

<p>You will need to buy a red cabbage prior to this activity. Red cabbages are available during winter and spring. One cabbage should make enough extract for an entire class of learners. You can prepare the extract in the class, or you could make it ahead of time and simply demonstrate the method (cutting the cabbage, boiling and straining it) to the learners without boiling the cabbage in class.</p>

<p/>

<p>If you are not able to get red cabbage, you can try using some of the other foods listed in the previous table which are also natural indicators. Another example which is easy to use and obtain is black tea.</p>

<p>Some other substances also change colour when an acid or a base is added to them. By changing their colour, they show that they have reacted with an acid or a base. That is why we call them <strong>acid-base indicators</strong>.</p>

<p>The most well-known acid-base indicator is a substance called <strong>litmus.</strong></p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0028.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Blue and red litmus paper.</figcaption></figure><p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Litmus is a coloured substance that comes from the pigments of a living organism called <em>lichen</em>. Pigments are coloured substances found in nature.</p>

<figure><img src="images/gr7mm03-gd-0029.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Litmus comes from pigments in the lichen which are found growing in many different places, mostly on rocks.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Litmus solution is most commonly soaked into paper, the paper is then dried and cut into strips we then call "litmus paper". It is just like the red cabbage paper we made earlier. Litmus paper is available in two colours: blue and red.</p>

<p/>

<p>How does litmus paper indicate whether a substance is an acid or a base? In the next activity, we will investigate how litmus responds to some household acids and bases.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">How does litmus respond to acids and bases?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>CAPS suggests that you also test various beverages to see whether they are acids, bases or neutrals. A suggestion is to do this investigation presented here first where learners first determine how litmus responds to acids and bases, and then if you have time as an extension, get learners to test various drinks, such as water, Ceylon tea, rooibos tea, orange juice, milk, coffee and any fizzy drink to see whether they are acids, bases or neutrals.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To determine how litmus responds to some household acids and bases.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong> What is your hypothesis for this investigation? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners may not yet know how litmus reacts to acids and bases, so they may have to come back to propose a new hypothesis when they are writing their conclusions. They should not be encouraged to come back to this space, cross out the hypothesis and write a new one which they know to be true. This is an important concept in science investigations - a hypothesis is a proposed explanation, which needs to be <strong>tested</strong> further using the scientific method. One can then verify whether the hypothesis was true (and it is accepted) or it is false (and it is rejected) and you come up with a new proposed hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:</strong></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>

<p>Write a conclusion based on your results in response to the initial aim for this investigation. </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>A conclusion must respond to the aim and hypothesis for the investigation. In this case the aim was to determine how litmus paper responds to some household bases and acids. Therefore a conclusion is: In response to some household acids and bases, red litmus paper turns blue in bases and remains red in acids, and blue litmus paper turns red in acids and remains blue in bases. Both red and blue litmus paper will remain red or blue, respectively, in the presence of neutral substances. Learners can see whether they reject or accept their hypotheses.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>Extension</strong>: If you have time in class with your teacher, use your knowledge of how litmus responds to acids and bases to test some of the beverages that you drink every day. You can use litmus paper to indicate whether beverages such as ceylon tea, rooibos tea, orange juice, milk, coffee and fizzy drinks are acids, bases or neutrals. If you do so, record your findings here: <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p>Do you think red cabbage paper makes a good acid-base indicator? Why do you say so? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. They should note that a good indicator is something which can tell you if it is an acid or a base, in that the same paper turns different colours whether in an acid or a base.</p>

<div class="note  col-md-10" data-type="keyconcepts"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Our tongues can sense 4 different flavours namely, sweet, salty, sour and bitter.</li>
<li>Our sense of taste protects us from eating foods that are harmful and stimulates us to eat foods that are nutritious and energy-rich.</li>
<li>Acids and bases are chemical opposites of each other.</li>
<li>Though it is not a good idea to taste chemicals, acids have a sour taste and bases taste bitter.</li>
<li>When they are in solution with water, acids feel rough and bases feel slippery.</li>
<li>Some acids and bases are present in foods and in household items. These are relatively safe to handle. Others are often very corrosive and should only be handled when you are wearing protective clothing.</li>
<li>Substances which are neither acidic nor basic, are called neutral substances.</li>
<li>When an acid is mixed with a base in the right quantities, they neutralise each other. That means they lose their power.</li>
<li>Some substances change colour when they react with an acid or a base. These substances are called acid-base indicators. One household example of an acid-base indicator is red cabbage juice.</li>
<li>Litmus is the best known of all acid-base indicators. It does not change colour in the presence of a neutral substance, but responds to acids and bases in the following way:
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>litmus is red in the presence of an acid; and</li>
<li>litmus is blue in the presence of base.</li>
</ul></li>

<p><strong>Concept map</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>The human tongue can taste 4 main different tastes. What are these? Fill them in the spaces below. You also need to complete the section of the concept map about indicators. Can you work out how to do this? You need to fill in the colour that litmus turns (or remains) in each either an acid or a base (or neutral).</p>
