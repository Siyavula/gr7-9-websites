<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>(2 weeks)</p>

<p>In Grades 6 and 7 learners covered material regarding the viewing of space and telescopes.</p>

<p>In Grade 6 they were introduced to telescopes including SALT and the SKA. In Grade 7, they focused on the historical development of modern astronomy including ancient observations and indigenous starlore all the way up to modern scientific developments.</p>

<p>In this chapter the focus is on how we observe objects in space using telescopes. Some history showing how early astronomers viewed and interpreted the stars and planets in the sky is also included. Learners will have the opportunity to conduct their own observations of the Southern Cross as well as learn about the latest telescopes being developed in South Africa.</p>

<p>The main aims of this chapter are to ensure that learners understand the following:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Early cultures studied the stars and planets using the naked eye. They often grouped stars together in patterns called constellations.</li>
<li>Astronomers now use telescopes to study galaxies, stars and planets.</li>
<li>Telescopes help astronomers see fainter objects, because they act as light collecting buckets.</li>
<li>South Africa is host to the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere and will be hosting the majority of the largest radio telescope ever, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).</li>
</ul><p>Section 3.1 covers the early observations of space and section 3.2 covers modern day telescopes.</p>

<p/>

<p>In Grade 7 learners were introduced to indigenous knowledge about the stars and planets under the historical development of astronomy. This section focused primarily on the practical uses of star observations, such as timekeeping and navigation, along with an introduction to starlore associated with the Moon, Milky Way and other celestial bodies. In this section the focus will lie in the observations of constellations (and the planets) and starlore associated with one example constellation.</p>

<p>A good way to introduce the topic of the early viewing of space, is to ask learners if they know of any stories about famous constellations or the planets. This facilitates discussions about constellations visible in the sky and how the stars are actually related in space.</p>

<p>In dark conditions away from city lights, thousands of stars are visible in the night sky. Early cultures around the world gazed at the stars in wonder. They noted the movement of the stars and planets across the sky and used this to mark the passage of time. People often grouped the stars they saw into patterns called <strong>constellations</strong><em>.</em> Early cultures tended to associate the stars and planets they saw in the night sky with animals or gods and told stories, which were passed on from generation to generation, about the patterns in the sky which were passed down from generation to generation.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Early telescopes were were used by merchants to spot approaching trade ships or pirates. Telescopes also gave rise to the first high-speed telecommunications networks, as spyglasses were used to observe signals from kilometers away.</p>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Today professional astronomers formally recognise 88 constellations, 23 of which are in the southern hemisphere.</p>
</div>
<p>The stars that are visible depend upon your location on Earth and also the time of year. The southern sky, which we see from South Africa, is full of beautiful stars and several prominent constellations are visible in the sky including the Southern Cross or Crux, Orion and Pavo the Peacock.</p>

<p>In the following activities you will have the opportunity to observe the night sky and familiarise yourself with some of the most famous southern constellations.</p>

</div><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Using star maps to observe the night sky</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In this activity learners will use the star map provided to identify three constellations in the night sky visible during September/October/November. If you want to generate a star map specific to your location and date you can freely download a sky map from <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="www.heavens-above.com"> www.heavens-above.com</a>. All you need to do is select the area from which you want to view, by clicking on 'select from map' or 'from database' and selecting your location. Your location will then be saved. You can then click on the 'Sky chart' link further down to view a map of the night's sky from your location at the current time. You can save and print this for learners. For example, here are the links to the sky maps for several places in South Africa.</p>

<p>A suggestion is to also organise this activity as a field trip at night. Go beyond the city lights to an area where you are able to view the stars more clearly without light interference. Also take note of when the full Moon occurs, as reflected light from the Moon can also interfere with star gazing.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>

<p>What did you notice about the orientation of the Southern Cross as you made your observations?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The constellation should appear to rotate in a clockwise direction over time. In early September its long axis is fairly horizontal in the sky but the constellation gradually rotates so that by early November its long axis is almost pointing downwards.</p>

<p>Some people believe that the builders of the ancient pyramids of Giza in Egypt placed them specifically to look the same from above as the three "belt stars" of the constellation Orion look from Earth.</p>
</div>
<p>Although the stars appear to lie in patterns when viewed from the surface of the Earth, in reality the stars within a constellation are unrelated, and they can lie at vastly different distances from Earth. When we look at the stars at night, we only see a two dimensional projection on the sky of three dimensional space, as you can see in this photograph showing the constellation, Orion.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0003.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The Orion Constellation, seen here as the three bright stars in the middle making up Orion's belt and the 4 stars in each corner.</figcaption></figure><p>You might imagine that all the stars lie at the same distance from Earth. This isn't true, the stars lie at different distances. The closest star in Orion is called Bellatrix and is around 250 light years away. The furthest star Meissa is around 1100 light years away, roughly the same distance as the Orion nebula (1300 light years). But, when viewed from Earth, we see them making up a pattern in relation to each other.</p>

<p>Now that you are familiar with some of the constellations in the Southern sky, including the Southern Cross you can learn what some of the early cultures in Southern Africa thought about them.</p>

<p>The /Xam Bushman imaged that the two pointer stars of the Southern Cross were two male lions who had once been men before they were thrown up into the sky to be stars by a magical girl. The three brightest stars in the Southern Cross were seen as female lions, perhaps women also changed into stars by the magical girl.</p>

<p>The Khoikhoi thought that the Pointers were the eyes of some great beast and they were called <em>Mura</em> which means <em>the eyes</em>.</p>

<p>In Sotho, Tswana and Venda cultures, these stars are called <em>Dithutlwa</em> which means <em>the Giraffes</em>. The bright stars of the Southern Cross are male giraffes, and the two Pointer stars are female giraffes. The Venda named the fainter stars of the Southern Cross <em>Thudana</em>, which means <em>the Little Giraffe</em>. The Sotho used these stars to indicate the beginning of the cultivating season which began when the giraffe stars were seen close to the south-western horizon just after sunset.</p>

<p>In Grade 6 learners were introduced to telescopes including the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). In this section learners explore how telescopes work in more detail. There is a particular focus on comparing the telescope with our eye. Simple ray diagrams are shown which link to material covered in Gr 8 Energy and Change, Chapter 4 on Visible Light.</p>

<p>Two case studies are explored in more detail: SALT and the SKA, and learners will find out why South Africa is an ideal location for professional telescopes.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot visit distant stars or galaxies to study them directly as they are so far away. Instead astronomers study stars and galaxies by analysing the visible light, radio waves and electromagnetic radiation that they receive from them. Human eyes can see very far. The Andromeda Galaxy which is 2.5 million light-years away is visible to the naked eye. However, we cannot make out any detail as it appears as only a tiny smudge on the sky to our eyes even though in reality it is 220 000 light years across.</p>

Humans can only see it as a tiny faint smudge in the sky with the naked eye.</figcaption></figure><p>Light is emitted from stars and galaxies and travels in a straight line in all directions. When you look at a star, you only see the light rays that hit your eye. In Energy and Change, we learned about visible light. How is the energy of light transferred through space?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>By radiation, as electromagnetic waves travel in straight lines.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The further away a star is, the more the starlight is spread out and so less of the total light from the star reaches your eye. This makes distant objects faint and difficult to see clearly. If we had huge eyes we would be able to see distant objects more clearly because our eyes would gather more of their light.</p>

<p>Do you remember making a pinhole camera in Energy and Change? Have a look at the following diagram which illustrates this again.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp3963344"><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0005.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Which way is the image projected onto the screen?</p>

</div><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Telescopes as light buckets</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In this activity learners will discover how a telescope collects more light than our eyes can and as a consequence can help us to see fainter and more distant objects. As well as demonstrating how telescopes collect light, this activity also shows learners how telescopes focus light from distant objects to a point. This activity introduces the concept of photons, or packets of light. This is not a formal part of the curriculum in Gr 8, and is not explained in detail. The idea that a finite amount of light hits a telescope mirror or eye per second is crucial to this activity and the understanding of why telescopes are useful. If you feel that you would rather omit the concept of photons, you could instead talk about the rice grains representing rays of light.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>There is only so much light emitted from an object each second. Little packets of light are called <strong>photons</strong>. Our eye needs at least 500 photons, or packets of light, coming into it every second for our brains to sense that something is there. In this activity you are going to represent photons from a distant galaxy using pepper grains or hundreds and thousands.</p>

<p>Telescopes have big lenses or mirrors to collect as much light as possible. This is how they are able to see faint objects. Telescopes also concentrate or focus the light and redirect it into our small eye so that we can see the dim object. Alternatively, telescopes can redirect the light into special detectors that record images, similar to a cell phone camera.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Compare your eye with SALT</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is an <strong>optional</strong> activity. In this activity learners work in pairs. Learners should estimate that their reaction time is of the order of 1/10th of a second. But as long as they estimate 1s or less this is perfectly fine. They will use this value as their eye's exposure time. In fact roughly every 1/15th of a second, the eye sends the brain another image. So the eye has about one-fifteenth of a second to collect light when making an image.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) takes pictures of some of the most distant and faintest objects in the Universe. SALT's camera takes images with exposure times typically of twenty minutes, after which the camera shutter closes and the resulting image is displayed on a computer. The longer the exposure, the more light that the telescope can gather to make the image. The human eye does not have a shutter. We seem to see continuously, rather than as a succession of still images. However, the eye does have a kind of exposure time. In this activity you will estimate the exposure time of your eye by estimating your reaction time and then compare it with SALT's typical exposure time.</p>

<p>Telescopes can collect more light from faint and distant objects because they have larger collecting areas <em>and</em> because they can accumulate light over longer periods of time to make an image. This means that you can see fainter objects with telescopes that you would be able to see using just your eye.</p>

<p>Telescopes also <strong>magnify</strong> (enlarge) the image that you see, so it takes up more room on your retina allowing you to see the object more clearly.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0015.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A convex (converging) lens used as a magnifying glass. The resulting image is larger than the object. Telescopes magnify images from distant stars and galaxies.</figcaption></figure><p>Magnification comes at a price however. A fixed amount of light is received from any object, so if you make the image larger, its gets fainter as the light is spread out within the image. This is why it is so important to collect as much light as possible.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p><strong>Extension content on another advantage of telescopes, namely angular resolution</strong></p>

<p>Telescopes also have another advantage over the eye. Telescopes can better distinguish between objects that are close together on the sky. The ability to see things that are close together as separate objects rather than seeing one smeared or fuzzy object results in a sharper image. In astronomy, "close together" means "separated by a small angle on the sky," so astronomers refer to the <strong>angular resolution</strong> of a telescope. The higher the angular resolution of a telescope, the better it is at seeing narrowly separated objects as individual objects and the sharper the images look.</p>

<p>The images below show what photographs of the same galaxy look like with different angular resolutions.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0016.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The same galaxy viewed with increasing angular resolution from (A) to (D). The image gets sharper with increasing angular resolution. In (A) the telescope is able to distinguish between objects separated by an angle of only 1/6 of a degree or more.

</div>
<p>The larger a telescope's mirror or lens, the better it is at seeing narrowly separated objects as individual objects and the sharper the images look.</p>

<p>The most important feature of a telescope is how much light it can collect, which depends upon the area of the lens or mirror. The larger the light collecting area, the more light a telescope gathers and the higher resolution (ability to see fine detail) it has. So the size of a telescope is far more important than its magnification.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p><strong>Misconception about magnification:</strong></p>

<p>Many students want to know how much a telescope "magnifies" an image as they think this is the most important characteristic of a telescope. Telescopes do magnify images but this is not the main reason why they are so useful. After all, a magnified dim image would still be dim and difficult to make out and a magnified blurry image would still be blurry and wouldn't help you see anything. Astronomers care more about how much light the telescope can collect and also its angular resolution: how bright, sharp and clear its images are. These properties both depend upon the size of the collecting mirror or lens rather than the magnification. With telescopes, bigger really is better.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Now that we have briefly looked at how telescopes work, we are going to look at the different types of telescopes, namely:</p>

</ul><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Optical telescopes</h3>

</li>
<li>
<p>Reflecting telescopes use <strong>mirrors</strong> to collect and focus the light from distant objects.</p>

</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-4">1. Refracting telescopes</h3>
<p>Refracting telescopes use a converging (convex) lens to collect and bend the light rays inwards to the focal point (also called the focus) of the telescope. The light collecting lens is called the objective lens.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp756928"><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0018.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>As astronomical objects are so far away, their light rays are considered to be parallel to each other.</p>
</div>
<p>Once light is brought to a focus, it is then magnified by another lens called the eyepiece lens. Look at the optical ray diagram below showing a simple refracting telescope.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp693152"><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0019.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The telescope objective lens collects and focuses the light from a distant tree forming a real inverted image of the tree. The eyepiece lens, like a magnifying glass, then enlarges the image collected by the objective lens, producing a larger, virtual image. This images is what we see when we look through the telescope.</p>

<p>What kind of lenses are the objective lens and the eyepiece lens?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Both of the lenses are convex lenses which means that they cause light rays to converge or come together.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>A<strong>real image</strong> is called real because light rays actually pass through the point where the image is formed. A <strong>virtual image</strong> is called a virtual image because the light rays do not actually come from the image, they just appear to have come from the image.</p>
</div>
<p>Look at the picture below which shows how white light is refracted (bent) as it travels through a prism. As we learned in Energy and Change, when light travels through glass it slows down and so it bends or refracts.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp9172576"><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0020.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Do all the colours undergo the same amount of refraction? Which colour is bent the most?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>No, Violet is bent the most. Bluer colours are slowed more than redder colours and so they are bent or refracted more.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>White light is a mixture of all the colours of the rainbow. Different colours are refracted by different amounts as they travel through the prism so the white light is split into its different colours. How do you think this affects the images produced by refracting telescopes?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learner-dependent answer. Answers could include that the images could look colour-separated and blurry.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Lenses are shaped to bend light by a certain desired amount. However, the different colours that make up white light bend by slightly different amounts. This means that different colours come to a focus at slightly different distances from the objective lens. Each colour will produce its own image and they will be slightly misaligned with each other resulting in a slightly blurry image. This effect is called <strong>chromatic aberration</strong> and all lenses suffer from this effect.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0021.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Blue light is bent more than red light and so different colours are focused at different distances from the lens. The different coloured images are overlaid upon each other and, because they are misaligned, the resulting image is blurry.</figcaption></figure><p>The main disadvantages of refracting telescopes are:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Light travels through the lenses in the telescope and so the lenses have to be perfect. There must be no bubbles of air in the glass which would distort the image. It is difficult to and expensive to make large perfect lenses.</li>
<li>The light travels through the lenses and so they can only be supported around their edges, where they are thinnest and weakest. This limits the size of refracting telescopes because if a lens is too large it will sag under its own weight and distort the image.</li>
<li>Lenses suffer from chromatic aberration which blurs the image.</li>
</ol></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">2. Reflecting telescopes</h3>
<p>In the 1680s, Isaac Newton invented the reflecting telescope. Reflecting telescopes use a curved primary mirror to collect light from distant objects and reflect it to a focus.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The first successful reflecting telescope built was the Newtonian Telescope, by Isaac Newton, which is where the design gets its name.</p>

</div><figure id="gd-idp7045840"><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0022.png" width="300"/></figure><p>There are many different types of reflecting telescopes. A <strong>prime focus reflector</strong> is the simplest type of reflector telescope. In this design, a recording structure is placed at the focal point to obtain the focused image. In the old days, in very large telescopes, a person would actually sit in an "observing cage" to view the image directly or operate a camera. However, now a detector is used and is operated from outside of the telescope. The position of the detector is shown in the following diagram with a red cross.</p>

<p>A <strong>Newtonian reflector</strong> reflects the light to an eyepiece on the side of the telescope tube. This design is often used for amateur telescopes because having the eyepiece on the side of the tube makes the telescope easy to use.</p>

<li>
<p>A <strong>Cassegrain reflector</strong> reflects light through a small hole in the primary mirror. This kind of telescope is often used for large professional telescopes as it allows heavy detectors to be placed at the bottom of the telescope. This makes them easy to reach for repairs and also means that the weight of the detectors does not affect the telescope tube.</p>

<p>SALT does not have a telescope tube. Instead there is a network of metal struts which support the tracker and payload at the top of the telescope. The whole telescope structure weighs 85 tons. The payload contains detectors which take pictures of the night sky.</p>

<p>Stars move during the night just as the Sun moves across the sky in the day. The telescope must follow the stars as they move. The tracker at the top of SALT is used to follow the drifting stars carrying the detectors along with it as it tracks the stars.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0029.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The SALT telescope structure. (Credit: SALT)</figcaption></figure><p>SALT is currently being used to study stars, in particular binary star systems where two stars orbit around each other. Astronomers also use the telescope to study galaxies and some of the most violent explosions in the Universe called supernovae and Gamma Ray Bursts which occur when massive stars explode at the end of their lives. SALT is also looking at the Universe on the largest of scales, in order to answer the questions how did the Universe begin, and what will happen to it in the future?</p>

<p>The Karoo is an ideal place to host SALT because it is far away from towns and cities so there is very little light pollution. The area is also at a high elevation, dry and there are no extreme weather conditions, such as flooding or storms. Despite it being so remote at the observatory site there is good infrastructure, including roads and electricity, in the surrounding area of Sutherland.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-7">Radio telescopes</h3><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>antenna</li>

<p>What is a radio telescope?<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cXOzAcWS8yY"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation (or light) that humans cannot see with their eyes. They have very long wavelengths compared to optical light. Purple light, for example, has a wavelength of 400 nm whereas red light has a wavelength of 700 nm. Radio wavelengths are much longer; radio waves have wavelengths from approximately one millimeter to hundreds of metres.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Do you remember learning about wavelength in Energy and Change? A wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on two consecutive waves.</p>
</div>
<p>Radio telescopes detect radio waves coming from distant objects. Radio telescopes have several advantages over optical telescopes. They can be used in bad weather, as radio waves are not blocked by clouds. They can also be used during the day and at night.</p>

<p>Many objects in space emit radio waves, for example some galaxies, stars and nebulae which are giant clouds of dust and gas where stars are born. Some objects emit radio waves but do not emit optical light, therefore looking at the sky at radio wavelengths reveals a completely different picture of our Universe. If your eyes could see radio waves at night, rather than white light, instead of seeing pointlike stars, you would see distant star-forming regions, bright galaxies and beautiful giant clouds around old exploded stars.</p>

<p>Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) is a new radio telescope in Chile's Atacama desert. It will open an entirely new 'window' into the Universe, allowing scientists to search for our cosmic origins.</p>

<p>Rapidly rotating star remnants, called pulsars, were first discovered using a radio telescope in 1967. Astronomers initially considered the possibility that the regular pulses of radio waves were signals from an alien civilisation but quickly realised that this was not the case.</p>
</div>
<p>Radio telescopes typically look like large dishes. The <strong>dish</strong> or <strong>antenna</strong>, acts like the primary mirror in a reflecting telescope, collecting the radio waves and reflecting them up to a smaller mirror which then reflects the radio waves to a radio wave detector. Radio wave detectors are called <strong>receivers</strong>. An <strong>amplifier</strong> amplifies the signal and sends it to a computer which processes the information from the receiver to create colour images which we can see.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp7398400"><img src="images/gr8eb03-gd-0031.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The sensitivity of a radio telescope depends upon the area of the collecting dish and the sensitivity of the radio receiver. In order to produce sharp radio images comparable to images from optical telescopes a radio telescope must be much larger than an optical telescope.</p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p><strong>Background information</strong></p>

<p>This is because the angular resolution depends not only on the diameter of the collecting mirror but also upon the wavelength of the light. The minimum angle at which two objects can be distinguished on the sky is proportional to the wavelength of light used and inversely proportional to the diameter of the collecting mirror. As radio waves are much longer than visible light, the diameter of the collecting mirror must increase to compensate if you require the same angular resolution.</p>

</div>
<p>Radio telescopes need to be placed far away from cities and towns as man-made radio interference can interfere with the telescope's observations.</p>

<p>The MeerKAT radio telescope array is currently under construction in the Northern Cape. MeerKAT is scheduled to be complete in 2016 and when it is finished it will have 64 radio dishes each 13.5 m in diameter.

<p>Many different countries are working together to build, and pay for, the SKA. At least 13 countries and close to 100 organisations are already involved, and more are joining the project. Most of the SKA will be located in South Africa. There will also be locations in Australia and some stations in eight African partner countries namely, Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zambia.</p>

<p>Radio waves and visible light form part of what is called the electromagnetic spectrum of light. There are other types of light at different wavelengths that we cannot see with our eyes including X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared light.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>You will learn more about these different types of light if you continue with Physical Sciences in Grade 10.</p>
</div>
<p>The Earth's atmosphere blocks X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared light and stops them from reaching the ground. So if we want to observe this kind of light from stars and galaxies, we need to put telescopes in space. This is why X-ray telescopes and infrared telescopes are placed in space.</p>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope is named after Edward Hubble, considered to be one of the most important cosmologists of the 20th century. Hubble discovered there were galaxies beyond our own and helped confirm that the universe is expanding.</p>
</div>
<p>The advantages of space telescopes are that they can observe the whole sky and operate during both night and day. Images taken with space telescopes are far sharper than images taken with telescopes on the ground, because images are not smeared or blurred by turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere, as with images take from ground telescopes. This is why the Hubble Space Telescope images are so detailed even though it is a relatively small reflective telescope. The major disadvantages of space telescopes are their costs and the fact that if something goes wrong they are extremely difficult to fix.</p>
