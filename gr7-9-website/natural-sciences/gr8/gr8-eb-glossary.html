<ul data-class="ListBulleted" class="glossary">
<li><p><strong>Alpha Centauri:</strong> our second closest <em>easily visible</em> star after the Sun; it is actually two stars orbiting very close together</p></li>
<li><p><strong>amplifier:</strong> a device which amplifies (to make something bigger) the radio wave signals</p></li>
<li><p><strong>antenna:</strong> the dish or other device used to collect radio waves in a radio telescope</p></li>
<li><p><strong>asteroid belt:</strong> the area where most asteroids are found in our solar system, lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter</p></li>
<li><p><strong>asteroid:</strong> a small rocky object orbiting the Sun</p></li>
<li><p><strong>astronomical unit (AU):</strong> the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, equal to around 150 million kilometres</p></li>
<li><p><strong>celestial:</strong> positioned in or relating to the sky, or outer space as observed in astronomy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>chromatic aberration:</strong> an optical effect where different colours are refracted by different amounts in a lens leading to a distorted image</p></li>
<li><p><strong>comet:</strong> a small object made of ice and dust which sometimes enters the inner solar system; when a comet enters the inner solar system, part of it evaporates to form a long tail of ice and dust pointing away from the Sun</p></li>
<li><p><strong>constellation:</strong> a group of stars that form a pattern in the sky when viewed from Earth</p></li>
<li><p><strong>convection:</strong> one of the three ways to transport heat energy (the other two are conduction and radiation); as a liquid or gas is heated, it becomes less dense and rises; while denser colder material sinks, creating a flow of moving liquid or gas which transports heat energy along with it</p></li>
<li><p><strong>dwarf planet:</strong> a large, roughly spherical object orbiting a star which cannot be classed as a planet because it is not large enough to sweep out other objects from its orbit</p></li>
<li><p><strong>filament:</strong> a threadlike structure in space containing galaxies and galaxy groups and clusters</p></li>
<li><p><strong>galaxy bulge:</strong> a spheroidal (rugby ball shaped) distribution of old stars at the centre of a galaxy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>galaxy cluster:</strong> a collection of over 50 or more galaxies, held together by gravity</p></li>
<li><p><strong>galaxy disk:</strong> the flat distribution of stars, gas and dust in a galaxy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>galaxy group:</strong> a collection of about 50 or less galaxies, held together by gravity</p></li>
<li><p><strong>galaxy:</strong> a collection of millions or billions of stars, gas and dust all held together by gravity</p></li>
<li><p><strong>gas giant:</strong> a large planet made mostly of gas with no solid surface; the four outermost planets in the solar system are gas giants</p></li>
<li><p><strong>habitable zone:</strong> the region surrounding a star in which water can remain in its liquid state</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kuiper Belt object:</strong> a small icy object orbiting the Sun out beyond the orbit of Neptune</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kuiper Belt:</strong> region of space filled with trillions of small objects that lie in the outer reaches of the solar system, past the orbit of Neptune</p></li>
<li><p><strong>light hour:</strong> the distance that light travels in one hour</p></li>
<li><p><strong>light minute:</strong> the distance that light travels in one minute</p></li>
<li><p><strong>light year:</strong> the distance that light travels in one year</p></li>
<li><p><strong>nuclear fusion:</strong> the process by which stars produce their energy; light atomic nuclei come together and merge to form heavier atomic nuclei, releasing energy as they do so; in the Sun, hydrogen nuclei fuse with other hydrogen nuclei to form heavier helium nuclei</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oort Cloud:</strong> a hypothetical huge cloud of icy objects (comets) surrounding the Sun at the very edge of our solar system at a distance between 5,000 and 100,000 times the Earth's distance from the Sun</p></li>
<li><p><strong>photosynthesis:</strong> the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesise foods from carbon dioxide and water producing oxygen as a byproduct</p></li>
<li><p><strong>primary mirror:</strong> the light-collecting mirror in an optical telescope</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Proxima Centauri:</strong> our second closest star after the Sun</p></li>
<li><p><strong>receiver:</strong> a device that detects radio wave signals</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SALT:</strong> the Southern African Large Telescope, the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SKA:</strong> the Square Kilometer Array, the largest planned radio telescope array in the world</p></li>
<li><p><strong>solar system:</strong> the Sun, and the collection of planets and smaller objects that orbit around the Sun</p></li>
<li><p><strong>solar wind:</strong> the continuous flow of charged particles from the Sun that extends out to the far reaches of the solar system</p></li>
<li><p><strong>spiral arm:</strong> a region of stars, gas and dust forming a curved shape spiraling out from the centre of a spiral galaxy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>star:</strong> a huge ball of burning gas which emits energy in the form of light and heat</p></li>
<li><p><strong>starlore:</strong> mythical stories about the stars, planets and constellations</p></li>
<li><p><strong>sunspot:</strong> a dark region or spot which appears on the surface of the Sun from time to time; sunspots are cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface</p></li>
<li><p><strong>telescope:</strong> an instrument used to look at distant objects, which makes distant objects appear brighter, larger and clearer. Some telescopes collect visible light (optical telescopes) and some collect radio waves (radio telescopes)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>terrestrial planet:</strong> a planet with a rocky surface like the Earth's surface; the four innermost planets in the solar system are terrestrial planets</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Universe:</strong> all of existence, including all planets, stars, galaxies, the space between objects, and all matter and energy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>void:</strong> a vast empty bubble in space found between filaments</p></li>
