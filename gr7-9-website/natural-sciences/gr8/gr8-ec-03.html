<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>This chapter builds on the Gr 6 and 7 electric circuits work, and the previous chapter of this book. Up until now, we have only been looking at simple circuits. We will now examine the concept of series and parallel circuits. We will look at the difference between these two set-ups in circuits, specifically looking at the effects of adding resistors in series or in parallel and observing the change in brightness of bulbs. The use of ammeters has also been included in this chapter. However, if you do not have these instruments, you can simply do a qualitative study, using the brightness of the bulbs.</p>

<p>You can also use the PhET simulations where learners can build their own circuits and test them out, observing the effects when they add or remove various components. These simulations will run directly within your browser from our website, <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.curious.org.za">www.curious.org.za</a>. Here is a link to a guide (in pdf format) written by PhET in the use of some of the electric circuit simulations: phet.colorado.edu/files/teachers-guide/circuit-construction-kit-dc-guide.pdf</p>

</ul></div>
<p>In the last chapter, and in Gr 6 and 7, we have been looking at electric circuits. These have mostly been series circuits. What does this mean? And how else can a circuit be arranged?</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-1">Series circuits</h2><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>series</li>
<li>ammeter</li>

</ul></div>
<p>A <strong>series circuit</strong> is one in which there is only one pathway for the electric current to follow. The components are arranged one after another in a single pathway. When we connect the components we say that they are <strong>connected in series</strong>. We have already seen examples of series circuits in the last chapter.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec03-gd-0001.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A series circuit with one pathway for the current, from the negative to the positive terminal of the battery.</figcaption></figure><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">Ammeter</h3>
<p>An ammeter is a measuring device used to measure the electric current in the circuit. It is connected into the circuit in series. The current is measured in <strong>amperes</strong> (A).</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The ampere is named after Andr&#233;-Marie Amp&#232;re (1775-1836), a French mathematician and physicist. He is considered the father of electrodynamics, which is the study of the effect of electromagnetic forces between electric charges and currents.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr8ec03-gd-0002.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An ammeter.</figcaption></figure><p>What is the symbol for an ammeter? Draw it here.</p>

<figure id="gd-idp11567136"><img src="images/gr8ec03-gd-0003.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>
</div>
<p>Do you think that an ammeter would have a high resistance or a low resistance to the current? Explain your choice.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Ammeters have an extremely low resistance because they must not alter the current they are measuring in any way.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The ampere is often shortened to 'amp'.</p>
</div>
<p>A series circuit only provides one pathway for the electrons to follow. Let's investigate what happens when we increase the resistance in a series circuit.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">What happens when we add more resistors in series?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The aim of this investigation is to show the learners that adding more resistors in series causes the overall resistance of the circuit to increase and that this reduces the current strength.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To investigate the effect of adding resistors to a series circuit.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is a good opportunity for group work if you have enough equipment, but make sure that each learner is able to connect an ammeter correctly and is able to read the ammeter scale accurately. If you do not have sufficient equipment for all the learners, you can do this experiment as a demonstration. Perhaps give several learners an opportunity to come up to the front and help to connect the ammeters. If you do not have any ammeters then you can use the brightness of the bulbs to indicate current strength. The larger the current, the brighter the bulb will glow. This means that if the bulb glows brightly, it must have a large current moving through it. If the bulb is dimmer, it means that there is a smaller current flowing through it.</p>

<p>If you do not have the physical apparatus for this investigation but you do have internet access, use the PhET simulations found here: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc"> http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc</a></p>

<p>The simulations are also useful because the ammeters (and voltmeters) commonly used in school laboratories are often not calibrated correctly or not serviced regularly and so often give slightly inaccurate results.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong> Write a hypothesis for this investigation.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is a learner-dependent answer. The hypothesis should relate the dependent and independent variables and make a prediction. The dependent variable will change as the independent variable is changed. Here is an example of a possible answer:</p>

<p>As the number of resistors increases, the current strength decreases.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>1,5 V cells</li>
<li>3 torch bulbs</li>
<li>insulated copper conducting wires</li>
<li>switch</li>
<li>ammeter</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is important that the torch bulbs have the same resistance and are not randomly selected. The switch is not an essential part of this investigation. It can be left out of the circuit.</p>

<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong></p>

<p>Complete the table:</p>
<table><tr><td><p><strong>Number of bulbs in series</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Brightness of bulbs</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Reading on ammeter (A)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td/><td/></tr></table><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The brightness of the bulbs is a qualitative comparison. Learners should use "bright, brighter, brightest" as a way to describe the glowing bulbs. The graph should show the quantitative data of the ammeter reading and the number of bulbs. If you do not have an ammeter to take readings, either do not draw a graph, or change the graph to a bar graph which has bright, brighter, brightest as the values on the y-axis. This is not a particularly useful graph but will give the learners a chance to practice drawing a bar graph and give them a visual representation of the decrease in current strength as the number of bulbs increases.</p>

<p/>

<p>These results are an example of possible results. The actual results obtained by the learners will differ but the trend should be similar. As the number of bulbs in series increases, both the ammeter reading and bulb brightness should decrease.</p>

<p>As more resistors are added in series, the total resistance of the circuit increases. As the total resistance increases, the current strength decreases. What would happen if we increased the number of cells connected in series? Would the current become larger or smaller? Let's investigate.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">How does adding more cells in series affect the current?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This investigation will show that adding more cells in series increases the current strength. Be careful with this activity because if you do not have enough resistance in your circuit, you can damage the torch light bulbs. Use at least two torch light bulbs or a torch light bulb and a resistor in order to keep the resistance high enough. If you have ammeters, you can use quantitative data to show that adding more cells in series increases the current strength. If you do not have ammeters, then use the brightness of the bulbs as qualitative data. Use terms such as dim, bright, brightest. The learners will not be able to draw effective graphs with the qualitative data but you could give them the example data in the teacher's guide and ask them to draw a line graph if they need practice.</p>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To investigate the effect of increasing the number of cells connected in series on the electric current strength.</p>

<p>We have seen that increasing the number of cells in series increases the current, but increasing the number of resistors decreases the current.</p>

<p>We will now investigate the current strength at different points in a series circuit.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Testing the current strength</h1><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>The first investigation looked at the decrease in current strength when more resistors were connected in series. This investigation confirms that the current strength is the same at all points in a series circuit. This is an optional investigation. This can be a demonstration if your equipment is limited. This is a good opportunity for group work, but make sure that each learner is able to connect an ammeter correctly and understands the ammeter scale.</p>

<p>In a series circuit, there is only one pathway for the electrons to move through. The current strength is the same everywhere in that pathway.</p>

<p>What have we learned about series circuits?</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>There is only <strong>one</strong> pathway for the electrons to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current flows at the<strong>samestrength</strong>everywhere in a series circuit, because there is only one pathway. We say that the current is the same at all points in the circuit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you add more resistors in series, the current in the whole circuit <strong>decreases</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Why does the current stay the same at all points? Let's think about how electric current moves through a circuit. Do you remember that we spoke about the delocalised electrons in metals in the last chapter?</p>

<p>The electrons in a conductor normally drift in various different directions within a metal, as shown in the diagram.</p>

The rate at which the electrons move, is determined by the resistance of the conductor.</p>

<p>There are electrons everywhere in the conducting wires and electrical components. When the circuit is closed, all the electrons start moving in the same general direction <strong>at the same time</strong>. This is why a light bulb turns on immediately when you close the switch.</p>

<p>In a series circuit, all the electrons travel through every component and wire as they travel through the circuit. All the electrons experience the same resistance and so they all move at the same rate.</p>

<p>This investigation will show the learners that increasing the number of resistors in parallel to each other, causes the overall resistance of the circuit to decrease and the current strength to increase. There is no need to discuss how to calculate the effective resistance of a parallel circuit. The learners just need a qualitative understanding.</p>

<p>The graph will show the relationship between the main current (reading on the ammeter) and the number of bulbs connected in parallel. As more bulbs are connected in parallel, the current strength should increase because the overall resistance of the circuit decreases. This means that the graph should be a straight line with an increasing trend. Standard ammeters may not be accurate enough to produce a perfectly straight line. This is not as important as seeing the upward trend.</p>

<p>These results are just an example. The actual results will depend on the circuit set up by the learner.</p>

<p>As more resistors are added in parallel, the total current strength increases. The overall resistance of the circuit must therefore have decreased. The current in each light bulb was the same because all the bulbs glowed with the same brightness. This tells us that the current of electrons must have split up and moved through each of the branches.</p>

<p>We can also connect cells in parallel. What would happen if we increased the number of cells connected in parallel? Would the current get stronger or weaker?</p>

<p>Adding cells in parallel has no overall effect on the current strength. The current strength stays the same if you add cells in parallel.</p>

<p>We saw that the current strength increased when bulbs were connected in parallel. However, we were only testing the current strength at one point in the parallel circuit. How does the current compare in the different pathways of the circuit? Let's do an investigation to find out.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Testing the current strength</h1><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>The first investigation looked at the increase in current strength when more resistors were connected in parallel. This investigation confirms that the current strength is not the same at all points in a parallel circuit. This is a good opportunity for group work, but make sure that each learner is able to connect and read an ammeter correctly. If you do not have enough equipment to allow for small groups to build the circuits, you can rather use this investigation as a demonstration. Perhaps give several learners an opportunity to come up to the front and help to connect the ammeters.</p>

<p>The current strength is not the same at all points in a parallel circuit. If the bulbs are identical, then the current is the same in the three branches, however the current in the main part of the circuit is greater than that in the individual pathways. The current in the main part of the circuit is the sum of the currents in the pathways.</p>

<p>What have we learned about parallel circuits?</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>There is <strong>more than one </strong>pathway for the current to follow.</p>
</li>
<li>The current divides between the different branches so that each branch gets some of the current. As the torch bulbs in each branch in our example were identical, the current divided equally between them.</li>
<li>
<p>If you add more resistors in parallel, the total current supplied by the cell in the circuit <strong>increases</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Why does the current divide when offered an alternative pathway?</p>

<p>Imagine that you are sitting in a school hall during assembly. You are bored and waiting for it to end so that you can go out to break to chat to your friends. There is only one exit from the hall. When you are dismissed, everyone has to exit through the same door. It takes a while because only some learners can leave at a time.</p>

<p>Now imagine that there is a second door that is the same as the first door. Now you and your friends have a choice of which door to go through. The speed at which the learners exit the hall will increase and some of you will exit through the first door while others will exit through the second door. No one can go through both doors at the same time.</p>

<p>This is similar to the way current behaves when in a parallel circuit. As the electrons approach the branch in the circuit, some electrons will take the first path and others will take the other path. The current is divided between the two pathways.</p>

<p>In the following circuit A1 = A4 and A1 = A2 + A3 and A4 = A2 + A3</p>
<figure id="gd-idp3348784"><img src="images/gr8ec03-gd-0037.png" width="300"/></figure><p>We have looked at how resistors and cells behave in series and parallel circuits. Let's look at how different metals conduct electricity. All conductors have some resistance in a circuit. Are some metals better conductors of electricity than others?</p>

<p>Let's have a look at which metals offer more resistance than others to the flow of charge (current) through an electric circuit .</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Which metals offer the most resistance?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This activity only compares the effect of the type of material on resistance. The other factors that affect resistance will be covered in the Grade 9 Energy and Change syllabus.</p>

<p>Each metal will have a particular resistance based on the resistivity. You do not need to measure the resistance of each metal, all that is required is a qualitative description of the light bulb. The brighter the light bulb, the higher the current. If there is a high current it means that there is little resistance. So the brighter the bulb glows, the less resistance offered by the metal wire. The learners may make small mistakes if the brightness of the bulbs is difficult to distinguish.</p>

<p>Use whichever metal wires you have available. Try to get copper and nickel. You could twist aluminium foil into a wire (just make sure it is the same length and approximate thickness as the other metals). Aluminium wire will often ignite if placed in a circuit so test it beforehand and make sure that it does not get too hot. If you use the materials listed below, then nichrome will have the highest resistance, followed by zinc, then aluminium and copper has the lowest resistance of the four.</p>

<p/><p/>

        
<p>Copper has an extremely low resistance, and so has a minimal effect on the overall resistance of the circuit. Other materials would add to the overall resistance of the circuit, decreasing the maximum possible current in that circuit.</p>

</div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-4">Other output devices</h2>
<p>Light bulbs are not the only devices used in electrical circuits. Devices that use electrical energy to function, including light bulbs, are called output devices. Let's look at some other common examples of output devices.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">LEDs (Light-Emitting Diodes)</h3>
<p>LEDs are widely used electronic devices. They are small lights but they do not have a filament like an incandescent bulb has. They therefore cannot burn out, as there is no filament to wear out, and they do not get as hot. LEDs are used in electronic timepieces, high definition televisions and many other applications. Larger LEDs are also replacing traditional light bulbs in many homes because they do not use as much electricity. They last longer than incandescent bulbs and are more efficient.</p>

</div><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Sankey diagrams</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Sankey diagrams were first introduced in the Gr 7 CAPS workbook as a way of representing the transfers of energy within a system, specifically focusing on the transfer of input energy to useful and wasted output energy. They provide a very clear illustration of the process. This links back to the previous chapter to reinforce learning.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>You might have drawn Sankey diagrams in Grade 7. If not, here is some quick revision.</p>

<p>In an energy system, input energy is transferred to useful output energy and wasted output energy. A Sankey diagram is a visual and proportional representation of the energy transfers that happen in a system.</p>

<p>For example, a kettle uses about 2000 J of input energy, but only about 1400 J is used to heat the water. The remaining 600 J is wasted as sound. Here is the Sankey diagram to represent the energy transfer.</p>
