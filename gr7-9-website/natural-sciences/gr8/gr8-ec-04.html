<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>3 weeks</p>

<p>This chapter focuses on the visible light spectrum and how we see and interpret light. The concepts of absorption, reflection and refraction of light will be covered. Some of these concepts were first introduced in Gr 7 Energy and Change when talking about heat (the transfer of energy). This also links to what learners would have covered in Gr 7 Planet Earth and Beyond on solar energy, the seasons and life on Earth.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will learn about <strong>visible light</strong>. We call it visible light because we can see it with our own eyes. There are different forms of light which we cannot see with our naked eyes. Ultraviolet light is an example of a form of light which we cannot see with just our eyes. We will focus our attention on the visible light spectrum and investigate how we are able to see different colours and how light behaves.</p>

<p>Where does light come from? Natural light comes from luminous objects such as the Sun and light bulbs. We say that these objects emit light.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The Moon is NOT a luminous object as it does not emit its own light light. It reflects the light from the Sun.</p>

<p>An exciting way to introduce this section is to turn your classroom into a <em>camera obscura</em>. Use black paper to cover all the windows and tape to block out any light coming in from under any doors. On one window, leave a small area of the window uncovered. Hang a white sheet in the centre of the room opposite to the exposed window. The view from outside should be projected onto the sheet. The image will be upside down. This is an inexpensive way to give the learners an opportunity to understand the rectilinear propagation of light.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Let's look at how light travels. We will make a simple camera to investigate how light travels.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Make a pinhole camera</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This activity allows the learners to produce images on a screen. The images formed by a pinhole camera can be used to explain and demonstrate that light travels in straight lines.</p>

<p>The Pringles chip can is the perfect shape for this activity. You could use any cardboard tube. Instead of the lid from the Pringles can you can use a piece of wax paper as the screen. This pinhole camera is essentially a miniature camera obscura.</p>

<p>If you are struggling with time, you could make one of these and demonstrate it to the learners instead of having each learner produce one.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Pringles chip can</li>

<li>ruler</li>
<li>drawing pin</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>You can also use black paper if you do not have aluminium foil. The foil is useful because it molds to the shape of the tube and helps prevent ambient light from entering.</p>

<p/>
</div>

<p/><p/>

        
<p>Learners should see an image on the "screen". The lid/wax paper is the screen. The learners should notice that the image is upside down.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>What happens when you move closer or further away from an object?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>When you move closer to the object, the image appears bigger than when you move further away.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>Did you see an upside down image? Why is it upside down?</p>

<p>We see objects because light reflects off them and enters our eyes. If the image is upside down it means that the light from the bottom of the object has arrived at the top of the screen and the light from the top of the object has reached the bottom of the screen, as shown in the following diagram.</p>

<p>A ray diagram is a drawing that shows the path of light. Light rays are drawn using straight lines and arrowheads, because light travels in straight lines. The figure below shows some examples of ray diagrams.</p>

<p>The visible light spectrum is the light that we are able to see with our naked eyes. Have you ever wondered why everything is colourful and not just black and white? Have you ever seen a rainbow and wondered where the colours have come from? The colours that we see everyday are part of the visible light spectrum. Let's investigate the visible light spectrum.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Splitting white light</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This activity is very simple and usually gives clear results. Try to darken the room as much as possible in order to get clear spectra. A ray box and power source are not essential for this activity. You can make your own simple ray box by using a piece of cardboard with a small slit cut into it. Hold the cardboard in front of a light bulb and the light will shine through the slit in a single beam of light. Use a table lamp or set up a circuit with a high wattage light bulb as a source of light.</p>

<p>The drawing should show the beam of white light entering the prism, passing through and emerging on the other side as the 7 colours of the visible spectrum. This is a typical image, which learners will see later in the chapter when we discuss refraction of light. They must note the relative bending of red versus blue light.</p>

<p>They tell us that white light is a mixture/blend/combination of the 7 colours of the visible spectrum.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>There are actually a large range of colours, but our eyes allow us to distinguish 7 colours.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>So, what have we learned so far? Light radiates from luminous objects and always travels in straight lines. The white light that we see is made up of the 7 different colours of the spectrum. When the 7 colours are travelling together we see them as white light.</p>

<p>The 7 colours of the visible spectrum are <strong>R</strong>ed, <strong>O</strong>range, <strong>Y</strong>ellow, <strong>G</strong>reen, <strong>B</strong>lue, <strong>I</strong>ndigo and <strong>V</strong>iolet. Each colour has a different wavelength and frequency. Have a look at the following image which shows the spectrum of visible light.</p>

<p>To do this accurately, find the centre of the circle and mark a dot there. Then draw a straight line from the centre to the edge of the circle. Next, align the straight edge of a protractor with the line you just drew, placing the end of the protractor right on the center of your circle. Look for 52 degrees and make a dot to mark this angle. Draw a line from the centre dot to this dot on the edge. The angle you drew is 1/7 of the circle. Repeat this until you have measured and drawn all segments. A complete rotation is 360 degrees and 360/7 = 51.4 which is why each segment you draw should be about 52 degrees. The correct angle for 6 segments would be 60 degrees.</p>

<p>So far we have been talking about the <strong>visible</strong> light spectrum. As we mentioned in the beginning, this is the light that we can see. We also spoke about how light travels in <strong>electromagnetic waves.</strong> We can only see light with a certain range of <strong>wavelengths</strong>. What does this mean?</p>

<p>The size of a wave is measured in wavelengths. A wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on two consecutive waves. Normally this is done by measuring from peak to peak or from trough to trough. Have a look at the following diagram which illustrates a wavelength.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm9766080"><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0019.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The wavelengths of the different colours of visible light are different lengths, as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp7407504"><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0020.png" width="300"/></figure><p>We can also talk about the frequency of a wave. If a wave has a long wavelength, then it has a low frequency; if it has a short wavelength, then it has a high frequency.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0021.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Of visible light, orange and red light have the longest wavelengths (and lowest frequency) and violet, indigo and blue have the shorter wavelengths (and highest frequency).</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to visible light, we only see wavelengths of 400 to 700 billionths of a meter. This is called the visible spectrum. But, light waves are just part of the wave spectrum. There is invisible light with shorter wavelengths, such as ultraviolet light, and there are longer wavelengths, such as infrared light.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Wavelengths can be as small as one billionth of a meter, as with gamma rays. Wavelengths can even be as long as meters, for example in radio waves.</p>

</ul></div>
<p>Three different things happen when light hits a surface, it can be <strong>reflected</strong> (bounce off), <strong>absorbed</strong> or <strong>transmitted</strong> (pass through). Glass reflects some light but most of the light is transmitted straight through. That's why we can see objects on the other side of a closed window.</p>

<p>We say that glass is <strong>transparent</strong>. Let's find out more about what this means. If a substance is not transparent, it is <strong>opaque</strong>.</p>

<p/>

<p>This activity will show learners that opaque objects cast shadows. You can give them specific shapes to cut out from cardboard or allow them to be creative with their designs. Have them cut out various shapes of different sizes from cardboard. This will allow them to see that larger objects cast larger shadows. The learners can use a white piece of paper as a screen or use the wall of the classroom. If they hold the shape on the desk then the shadow would be cast on the desk but a screen would be more useful. The classroom should not be brightly lit when doing this activity as overhead lights may affect the shadows.</p>

<p>When you held the cardboard up to the light, did it allow light to pass through it? How do you know this?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>No, light did not pass through as it forms a shadow on the opposite wall.</p>

<p>What did you notice about the shadows formed by the different size cardboard shapes?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The larger the shape, the larger the shadow.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>Draw a diagram to show how the shadow is formed behind the opaque shape. Use straight lines with arrowheads to represent the rays of light.</p>

        
<p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

        </div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>This is an example of the type of diagram the learners may draw. They need to show the opaque object between the light source and a screen. They need to show rays of light leaving the light source and moving in straight lines on either side of the shape.</p>

        <figure id="gd-idm10944448"><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0022.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>The distance between the shape and the light source was kept the same. What do you think would have happened to the shadow if the distance was increased?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The answer calls for learners to predict something they have not tested. The shadow should become larger if the object is closer to the light source and smaller if the object is further from the light source.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>Test your idea from question 5 by moving your cardboard shapes closer to and further away from the light source. What do you see? Were you correct in your prediction?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>This answer is learner dependant because it depends on their prediction for question 5. Learners should describe seeing that the size of the shadow decreased as the distance increased or that the size of the shadow increased as the distance decreased.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Light travels in straight lines. It cannot bend around an object. Light cannot pass through the cardboard and so a shadow is formed. Light can pass through the clear plastic and so the area behind the plastic is bright.</p>

<p>It is neither completely transparent or completely opaque. The shopping bag is translucent or semi-transparent.</p>

<p>Some of the light can pass through the translucent plastic but not all of it, this means that the shadow is not as dark.</p>

<p/>
</div>

<p>What have we learned? Shadows are formed because light travels in straight lines and cannot pass through opaque objects.</p>

<p>Substances which transmit most of the light and only absorb or reflect a little bit are called <strong>transparent</strong>. Can you list some everyday objects which are transparent?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Glass, some plastics, cellophane, water etc.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Substances which completely reflect or absorb light without transmitting any are called <strong>opaque</strong>. Can you list some everyday objects which are opaque?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Bricks, wood, walls, skin etc.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Some substances, such as the plastic shopping bag, allow some light to pass through, but not all of it. This substance is <strong>translucent</strong>, or <strong>semi-transparent.</strong></p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0023.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Shadows can be useful. Sundials have been used since ancient times as a time-keeping device, like a watch or a clock. As the Sun moves across the sky, the shadow cast by the style moves across the surface of the sundial. The surface is marked with numbers, allowing the shadow to indicate time of day.</figcaption></figure><p>We can use transparent objects to make filters. If we want red light we use a red glass bulb or a red plastic film placed in front of the light. Only red light is able to transmit through the red glass or plastic. The other colours are absorbed by the filter.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0024.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">These are different colour filters for a camera. The red filter will only allow red light through and so the photograph will have a red effect applied to it. The other colours of light are absorbed by the filter.</figcaption></figure><p>Now that we have seen some examples of transparent and opaque substances, let's take a closer look at what it means to absorb or reflect light.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Absorption of light</h2><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The absorption of the different colours of light links back to Grade 7 Energy and Change. Learners will have learnt that matt black surfaces absorb heat from the Sun and that white and silver objects reflect the heat from the Sun. The energy which is reflected from surfaces can be seen as different colours. This is because each colour has its own frequency which is determined by the amount of energy of the released photons.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Look at this picture of a ladybird. Why is it red and black? And why is the leaf so green? How do we see the different colours? It all has to do with what happens when light hits a surface.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0025.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A ladybird.</figcaption></figure><p>When light hits a surface, some of the light is absorbed and the rest is reflected. It is the reflected light that reaches our eyes and allows us to see the object. Previously, we learned that white light is a mixture of different colours. When white light from the Sun hits the red shell of the ladybird all of the colours are absorbed, except red. Red light is reflected back to our eyes and so we see a red ladybird.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0026.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">We see the red shell of the ladybird as red light is reflected and the other colours are absorbed.</figcaption></figure><p>The green leaf absorbs all the colours except green which it reflects back into our eyes.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0027.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">We see a green leaf as green light is reflected and the other colours are absorbed by the leaf's surface.</figcaption></figure><p>What about the black spots of the ladybird? Is black a colour? The black spots on the ladybird absorb <strong>all</strong> the colours and no light is reflected. That is why they appear black.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Although we can get black paint as a pigment, black is not a colour of light. Black is the result of the complete absorption of light.</p>
</div>
<p>Do you remember learning about heat as energy transfer in Gr 7? We looked at the absorption of heat. We saw that black, matt objects absorbed all of the light energy, while white objects reflected all of it. Black, matt (not shiny) objects absorb all of the colours of light and reflect none and so appear black to our eyes.</p>

<p>What about a white object? Why do you think white objects look white? Have a look at the following diagram for a clue.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>White objects do not absorb any of the colours but reflect all of them together and so the object appear white to our eyes.</p>

When light strikes a reflective surface, it can change direction. Let's look at how this happens.</p>

<p>When light reflects off a surface the ray which hits the surface, it is called the <strong>incident ray</strong>. The ray of light which is reflected from the surface is called the <strong>reflected ray.</strong> When we draw diagrams of reflection we also draw in an imaginary line to help us measure different angles. This line is called the <strong>normal</strong>. The normal line is always drawn perpendicular to the surface.</p>

<p>Between the normal line and the incident and reflected rays, there are two angles. These are:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><strong>angle of incidence</strong> - the angle between the incident ray and normal line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>angle of reflection</strong> - the angle between the reflected ray and normal line</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The following diagram explains these concepts.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Is there a relationship between the angles of incidence and reflections?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners will see that the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. Learners must save some of the sheets for the next activity where you will use a piece of crumpled aluminium foil instead of the mirror.</p>

<p>Another way to do this investigation is to use a sheet of corrugated cardboard instead of paper. Learners can then stick pins into the cardboard along the light ray and then draw in the lines later.</p>

<p>Learners will have their own versions. An example of an appropriate question would be: 'How is the angle of reflection related to the angle of incidence of the incident ray?' It is important that the question relates the two angles in some way.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>

<p>What can you conclude based on your results?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In reflection, the angle of reflection is always equal to the angle of incidence.</p>

<p>In reflection, not only is the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection, but the incident ray and reflection ray are also in the same<strong>plane</strong>.</p>

<p>Whenever light is reflected from a surface, the angle of incidence to equal to the angle of reflection. On a smooth surface all the light rays are reflected in the same way and so the image is clear and focused.</p>

</div>
<p>How is it that we are able to see light? Light that is absorbed by objects does not enter the eye. Only reflected light or direct light from luminous objects can enter the eye and be interpreted. Have a look at the following image which shows the outer structure of the eye.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm12683104"><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0047.png" width="300"/></figure><p>We can see the iris, the pupil and the sclera. The sclera is a the tough white, outer part of the eye, which acts as protection. The iris is the coloured part of the eye which differs from person to person. It is circular and surrounds the pupil. Light enters the eye through the pupil.</p>

In bright light, the pupil contracts (gets smaller) to let less light through (as on the left), and in low light your pupil dilates (gets bigger) to let more light through (as on the right).</figcaption></figure><p>Let's take a look at the internal structure of the human eye. The following diagram shows a cross section through the eye. The eye is actually a large ball, and only a small part is visible on the outside. Covering the iris is a tough, transparent layer called the cornea. Behind the iris is the lens. Both the cornea and the lens help you to focus the light entering your eyes, as we will learn about in the next section.</p>

The retina is a layer of tissue lining the back of the eyeball, as indicated in the diagram, it is the yellow layer. The retina consists of cells which are sensitive to light. Light enters the eye and forms an image on the back of the eyeball. Light hitting the retina is similar to light hitting the screen in the pinhole camera. The receptor cells convert the light energy into electrical nerve impulses. These impulses travel out of the eye through the optic nerve and to the brain where they are interpreted as sight.</p>

<p>So how do we see colour? Do you remember when we spoke about why the ladybird appears red and black? Look at the following diagram again.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm967392"><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0050.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The white light hits the ladybird's surface. The white light has all the colours of light, but when it hits the red surface, only the red light is reflected. The other colours are absorbed by the red surface. This means that when we look at the red parts of the ladybird, we only get red light reflected into our eyes. Therefore, when this reflected light hits our retina and the electrical impulse is sent to our brains, we see the red colour.</p>

<p>Do you remember the last time you drank a cold drink with a straw? Did you notice that the straw did not look straight anymore once it was in the water or cool drink?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>You should do this in front of the class, or else put a glass of water in front of each learner. It is a really easy demonstration. All you need is a glass of water and a straw. If you do not have a straw, a pencil works really well.</p>

<p/>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0057.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Why does the pencil in this glass of water look bent?</figcaption></figure><p>Let's investigate this by examining what happens to light when it passes through a glass block.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">What happens to light when it passes through a glass block</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>You do not need a ray-box for this investigation. A laser, such as those found on keyrings, or a light bulb can be used. If you use a light bulb, you need to make a cardboard screen. Cut a thin slit into the cardboard and hold it in front of the light bulb, this will create a ray of light suitable for the investigation.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>We are going to investigate what happens to a ray of light when it passes from air and into a glass block and then from the glass block back into air. We are going to use a glass block with parallel sides.</p>

<p>Before we start the investigation, we need to think about how we are going to determine if light changes direction or not. Do you remember in the investigation on reflection where we measured the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection? What did we find in this investigation?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>When light passes through a transparent substance, we can also measure the angles. Look at the following diagram. The angle of incidence (i) is measured between the incident light ray and the normal line. As the light passes through the transparent substance, the angle of refraction (r) is the angle between the refracted light ray and the normal.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0058.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A light ray passing from one medium to another.</figcaption></figure><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners can come back to this diagram and mark in which is the more dense medium (glass) and which is the less dense medium (air). In this diagram, medium 1 is air and medium 2 is glass.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>In the diagram above, you can see that the angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence. Therefore, the refracted light ray changed direction when it entered the transparent medium. We can also say something about which direction it bent towards. Did the light ray bend towards or away from the normal line?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The refracted ray bent <strong>towards</strong>the normal line.</p>

<p>Learners can come back to this diagram and mark in which is the more dense medium (glass) and which is the less dense medium (air). In this diagram, medium 1 is now the glass and medium 2 is air.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>In the diagram above, does the refracted ray change direction when it enters the transparent medium? Give a reason for your answer.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Yes, it changes direction as the angle of incidence is not equal to the angle of refraction. The angle of incidence is smaller than the angle of refraction.</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

</div>
<p>The angle of incidence is not equal to the angle of refraction because the light has changed direction as it enters the glass. Therefore, when light travels from one medium to another, it bends, or changes direction. This is called <strong>refraction</strong>. When light enters a different medium at right angles then it does not change direction.</p>

<p>So why does the light refract? Light behaves as a wave does and waves travel at different speeds in different media. For example, light travels faster in air than it does in water. When light enters a different medium, it changes speed, and if it entered at an angle other than 90o, then it also changes direction. The more dense the medium, the slower the light moves.</p>

<p>Do you remember learning about density last term in Matter and Materials? Write down your own definition for density in the space below.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This question is included to check what learners remember from the previous term and to reinforce learning. We also need to show that although we learn about Natural Sciences within the four Knowledge Strands, many concepts are integrated and linked across the strands. Density is a measure of how much mass of a material fits into a given volume. We say density is the ratio of mass to volume, or mass per unit volume. We can write a mathematical relationship to show this ratio as follows: density = mass/volume.</p>

<p>If light moves from a less dense medium, like air, into a denser medium, like glass, then the light slows down. The light will bend towards the normal line.</p>

The light bends when it moves from one medium to another. Light moves from the air to glass to water, and therefore changes direction.</p>

<p>If you have stood in a pool of water before and looked down, have you noticed how short your legs appear to be? Let's have a look at this a bit more in the next activity.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Magic coin trick</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This activity will show the learners that bending of light will affect what we are able to see. The coin is not visible until the water is added. The water causes the light rays from the coin to refract (bend) towards the learner's eye. This allows the learner to see the coin.</p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem"> 
<p>Explain why the coin can be seen when the water is added, but not before. The diagrams below will help you explain what is happening in words.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>When there is no water in the bowl there is no direct line of sight from the learner's eye to the coin. When water is added the light from the coin leaves the water and is refracted. The learner's brain detects the refracted light and as the brain knows light travels in straight lines, the coin appears to be higher in the water.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The diagrams used here show the container as transparent so that you can see the coin inside, whereas you will actually be using an opaque container.</p>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Refraction can be used to explain why images appear to be distorted when we view them through transparent mediums. For example, if you are looking at your legs or hands through some water, they will appear closer than they actually are as the light is refracted. Look at the photograph of the glass with water in it in front of diagonal lines. Can you see how the lines are distorted when the light travels through the water and glass compared to when it does not?</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0067.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Light refraction through glass and water.</figcaption></figure><p>Can you remember how we split white light into the separate colours of the visible spectrum in the beginning of this chapter? What did we use to do this in the activity?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>We used a triangular prism. Learners have already experimented with this to show that white light is actually composed of 7 different colours. However, you can repeat this activity again to explain why this happens in terms of refraction.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>We can do this because the different colours of light bend by different amounts. The amount of refraction depends on the type of light entering the medium. Different colours of light will slow down to different speeds.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0068.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Refraction through a triangular prism.</figcaption></figure><p>When the white light entered the prism it refracted. The different colours of light travel at different speeds in the prism so they refracted at different angles and split up. Red light refracts the least and the blue light refracts the most as you can see in the following diagram.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm1493984"><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0069.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Prisms are not the only objects that can split white light into separate colours. In fact, a rainbow is a good example of white light splitting up.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0070.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A rainbow.</figcaption></figure><p>Light from the Sun enters the raindrops and refracts. The light is then reflected off the back of the raindrop. When the light passes out of the raindrop it is refracted again and the colours split up even more as shown in the diagram.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0071.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A raindrop refracts and reflects light, dispersing white light into the colours of the visible spectrum.</figcaption></figure><p>What colour is at the top of a rainbow and which colour is at the bottom?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Red is at the top and violet is at the bottom.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Does this match the order which we see in the diagram showing how light is refracted and reflected in a raindrop?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>No, it does not. It is the reverse order.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>How does this happen? When we see a rainbow, we see a combination of millions of raindrops. Although each raindrop refracts and reflects all 7 colours, we only see only colour of light reflected from each particular raindrop. This depends on the angle of the raindrop from our position. Therefore, the raindrops higher up in the sky reflect red light to us and the rain drops lower down reflect violet light to us. This is shown in the following diagram.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0072.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">We see rainbows with red at the top and violet at the bottom due to the combination of millions of raindrops.

<p>Do you remember when we spoke about how we see light and the structure of the eye, we mentioned that there is a lens just behind the iris? Another place where you may have seen lenses before are in reading glasses which some people wear to correct their vision. Or, have you seen how a magnifying glass makes things appear bigger. What are lenses and how do they work?</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0073.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A magnifying glass makes things look bigger.</figcaption></figure><p>A lens is a transparent object which focuses or refracts light. When light is spread out, we say it has <strong>diverged</strong>. Some lenses will diverge light while others will <strong>converge</strong> light, bringing the light rays together. When light rays are all brought to the same point, we say they have been <strong>focused</strong>. Let's have a look at this more closely.</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A magnifying glass is an example of a converging lens.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Let's think about how this works. Imagine you are looking at the ladybird from the beginning of the chapter through a magnifying glass. The ladybird looks bigger than what it actually is. When the object you are viewing is <strong>closer</strong> to the lens than the focal point, you see a virtual image of the ladybird that is <strong>larger</strong> than the object.</p>

<p>Have a look at the first diagram below. Can you see that the ladybird is between the focal point and the lens? The rays reflected from the ladybird are refracted by the magnifying glass and enter the person's eye.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm9592176"><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0082.png" width="300"/></figure><p>In the next diagram you can see how your eyes see a virtual image of the ladybird which is bigger than the object. The more curved the convex lens is in a magnifying glass, the greater its ability to magnify objects.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm9589008"><img src="images/gr8ec04-gd-0083.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>When you hold a magnifying glass up and view a distant object, the object appears smaller and upside down. Unlike when viewing the ladybird close up, the distant object is<strong>beyond</strong> the focal point of the lens, which results in this effect.</p>

<p>How do lenses work?<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/GABjoO">bit.ly/GABjoO</a></p>
</div>
<p>Do you remember what the human eye looks like? We have lenses in our eyes to allow us to see. The light enters the eye and passes through the lens. The lens focuses the light onto the back of our retina so that a clear image is formed. What type of lens do we have in our eyes? Give a reason for your answer.</p>

<p>A biconvex (converging) lens as it needs to focus the light rays onto the back of the retina.</p>

</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>A contact lens is designed to rest on the cornea of the eye and correct vision. Leonardo da Vinci was the first to come up with the idea in the 16th century to help prevent eye infection.</p>
</div>
<p>In order for a clear image to form, the lens in our eye needs to focus the light rays coming into our eyes so that the focal point falls on the retina. This depends on the shape of the lens in our eyes. Sometimes, people have lenses in their eyes that cannot focus properly. Have a look at the following diagram which shows a normal eye and then an eye which focuses before the retina (near-sighted) and behind the retina (far-sighted).</p>

<p><strong>
              <u>Optometry</u>
            </strong></p>

<p>Optometrists measure the efficiency of the patient's eyes. They examine eyes for vision problems, disease and other abnormal conditions. They test for proper depth and colour perception and the ability to focus and coordinate the eyes. They specialize in visual defects They are able to prescribe spectacles or contact lenses to rectify or alleviate visual defects such as far-sightedness, short-sightedness, astigmatism (image distortion) and presbyopia (far-sightedness as the result of age).</p>

<p>illumination engineering is the study and use of lighting in various situations, buildings and community spaces, such as sports and recreational lighting, lighting industrial facilities, roadway lighting, museum lighting. Illumination engineering can be studied at university by pursuing a degree in electrical engineering. The Illumination Engineering Society of South Africa also offers courses, details are on their website.</p>

<p>The Zooniverse website provides a great overview of the various citizen science projects that learners can get involved in. There is a huge variety of projects, including helping to identify possible planets around stars, analysing real life cancer data, looking at tropical cyclone data and listening to the calls from whales or bats.</p>

<p>Citizen science is scientific research that is conducted in whole or in part by nonprofessional scientists, specifically the general public. Encouraging learners to get involved in some of these projects will open their eyes to the possibilities out there, and also add meaning and value to what they learn within the Natural Sciences classroom. <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/14JxLsw">bit.ly/14JxLsw</a></p>

<li>Light cannot pass through opaque objects.</li>
<li>Light can pass through transparent objects.</li>
<li>Light is absorbed by some materials.</li>
<li>A material appears to be a certain colour because it reflects that part of the colour spectrum. Other wavelengths of light are absorbed.</li>

<p>White light is made up of a spectrum of 7 colours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the light passes from the air into the glass at an angle, it refracts and bends. The colours of the spectrum bend by different amounts causing the light to disperse. When the light leaves the other side of the prism, it refracts again and the colours bend even more and split up showing the seven colours.</p>

<p>Colour 1 is red and colour 7 is violet as red light bends the least and violet light bends the most.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
         
<p>An opaque object casts a shadow as it does not let any light pass through it. The light is either reflected or absorbed. There will be a shadow on the opposite side to the light source as the light cannot reach there due to the object.</p>

<p>The light is reflected off the poles and then it reflects off the surface of the water and into our eyes.</p>

<p>Two learners are discussing the colours of light. They decide that white and black are not really colours of light. If they are not colours, then how can we see them? [5 marks]</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>White is a combination of all of the colours in the visible spectrum. White objects reflect all the colours equally and so we see the mixture of colours as white. Black is an absence of colour. Black objects absorb all of the colours and reflect none. This means that we don't see any coloured light from that object.</p>

<p>Far-sightedness can be corrected using a convex lens. This is when the light focuses on a point behind the retina so the image is blurred. A convex lens is used to bend the light rays before they enter the eye so that when they do pass through the lens in the eye they are focused clearly on the retina.</p>
