<ul data-class="ListBulleted" class="glossary"><li><strong>air valve:</strong> a device that works as a gateway to allow air to flow in only one direction (either into or out of something</li>
<li><strong>atomic nucleus:</strong> a tightly packed cluster of protons and neutrons at the centre of the atom</li>
<li><strong>atoms:</strong> the fundamental particles that all matter is made up of</li>
<li>boiling point: the temperature at which a particular material changes from the liquid to the gas state (boils)</li>
<li><strong>boiling:</strong> occurs <em>within a liquid</em> when it is heated to its boiling point and particles escape as bubbles of gas from the liquid</li>
<li><strong>chemical bond:</strong> a special force that holds the atoms in a molecule together</li>
<li><strong>chemical</strong><strong>equation:</strong> a way of representing a chemical reaction in terms of the chemical formulae of the reactants and products</li>
<li><strong>chemical formula:</strong> a combination of element symbols that shows the types and number of atoms in one molecule of a certain compound</li>
<li><strong>chemical reaction:</strong> a process in which chemical bonds are broken and new ones are formed between atoms; atoms in the starting compounds, called reactants, are rearranged to form new compounds, called products</li>
<li><strong>chemical reaction:</strong> an event during which the atoms in molecules are rearranged to form new molecules</li>
<li><strong>cluster:</strong> (verb) to come together and form a tight group</li>
<li><strong>coefficients:</strong> the numbers in front of the atom and molecule formulae in the chemical equation; they represent the ratio of the numbers of individual molecules that take part in the chemical reaction</li>
<li><strong>collide:</strong> (noun: collision) to bump or crash into something</li>
<li><strong>compound:</strong> a pure substance in which atoms of two or more different chemical elements are bonded in some fixed ratio</li>
<li><strong>compress:</strong> (adjective: <em>compressible</em>) to squeeze the particles of a material closer together</li>
<li><strong>condensation:</strong> when energy is removed and a gas changes state to a liquid</li>
<li><strong>constant motion:</strong> something that is in constant motion never stops moving</li>
<li><strong>contract:</strong> the physical size of an object gets smaller</li>
<li><strong>controlled experiment:</strong> an experiment in which the variables are controlled so that the results can be compared to those obtained in another experiment</li>
<li><strong>decomposition reaction:</strong> a chemical reaction in which a given molecule is broken up and recombined into smaller molecules</li>
<li><strong>density:</strong> the mass of a substance in a given space (volume)</li>
<li><strong>diffuse:</strong> (noun: diffusion) the movement of particles so that they end up spread out randomly and uniformly in a given space</li>
<li><strong>disordered:</strong> untidy; without regular arrangement</li>
<li><strong>distinction:</strong> the separation of things into different groups according to features or characteristics</li>
<li><strong>electrons:</strong> the smallest of the three types of sub-atomic particles; they are negatively charged and are located outside the atomic nucleus</li>
<li><strong>element:</strong> a pure substance made up only of atoms of the same kind</li>
<li><strong>energetic:</strong> full of energy</li>
<li><strong>evaporation:</strong> when energy is added and the particles <em>at the surface</em> of a liquid change state to a gas</li>
<li><strong>expand:</strong> the physical size of an object gets bigger</li>
<li><strong>fermentation:</strong> a chemical reaction that occurs in the presence of yeast and/or bacteria, during which a sugar is converted to an alcohol or an acid</li>
<li>forces of attraction: forces that particles experience which draw them closer to each other</li>
<li><strong>immiscible:</strong> incapable of mixing or blending</li>
<li><strong>impact:</strong> (noun) effect</li>
<li><strong>mass:</strong> a measure of the amount of matter in an object or material</li>
<li>melting point: the temperature beyond which a particular material changes from the solid to the liquid state (melts)</li>
<li><strong>melting:</strong> when energy is added and a solid changes state to a liquid</li>
<li><strong>mixture:</strong> a combination of two or more pure substances mixed together</li>
<li><strong>molecule:</strong> two or more atoms that have chemically bonded with each other; the atoms in a molecule can be of the same kind (in which case it would be a molecule of an element), or they can be of different kinds (in which case it would be a molecule of a compound)</li>
<li><strong>neutrons:</strong> a type of sub-atomic particle similar to protons in mass and size, but neutral (without charge); neutrons together with protons make up the atomic nucleus</li>
<li>observation: an observation is something we can see, hear, taste, smell or feel</li>
<li><strong>phenomenon:</strong> (plural: phenomena) an event or occurrence that we can observe with our senses</li>
<li><strong>physical</strong><strong>quantity:</strong> something that can be measured or estimated</li>
<li><strong>postulate:</strong> a claim that can be supported by experimental evidence</li>
<li>pressure gauge: an instrument used to measure the gas pressure inside something</li>
<li><strong>product:</strong> a substance that forms during the reaction; it will be present after the reaction has taken place</li>
<li><strong>protons:</strong> a type of sub-atomic particle that is positively charged and occurs inside the atomic nucleus along with neutrons</li>
<li><strong>pure substance:</strong> matter that consists of the same material throughout; two classes exist, namely elements and compounds</li>
<li><strong>random:</strong> unpredictable</li>
<li><strong>rate:</strong> how fast or slow an event (e.g. diffusion) occurs</li>
<li><strong>reactant:</strong> a substance that is present before the reaction takes place; it is a starting material of the reaction</li>
<li><strong>reaction flask or reaction vessel:</strong> the container in which the reaction has taken place; small scale chemical reactions done in a laboratory are usually performed in glass beakers or flasks</li>
<li><strong>regular arrangement:</strong> an arrangement of particles in a neatly packed, consistent and repetitive pattern</li>
<li><strong>reinforce:</strong> to make stronger, usually by the addition of another material or other form of support</li>
<li><strong>reverse:</strong> in this chapter reverse means 'opposite', as in: melting and freezing are <em>reverse</em> processes (the opposite of each other)</li>
<li><strong>scientific model:</strong> a set of ideas that represents a concept, object, or process in nature to help us understand it</li>
<li><strong>scientific theory:</strong> an explanation of scientific phenomena or aspects of the natural world, supported and confirmed by facts obtained through observation and experimentation</li>
<li><strong>solidifying:</strong> (freezing) when energy is removed and a liquid changes state to a solid</li>
<li><strong>sub-atomic particle:</strong> a particle that is smaller than the atom and occurs inside the atom</li>
<li><strong>transformation:</strong> change; to transform is to change from one form into another</li>
<li><strong>uniform:</strong> the same throughout</li>
<li><strong>vapour:</strong> the gaseous state of a substance that is normally liquid or solid at room temperature, such as water that has evaporated into the air</li>
<li><strong>vibrate:</strong> to move rapidly back and forth</li>
<li><strong>vigorous:</strong> strong and forceful</li>
<li><strong>volume:</strong> a measure of the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional object or material</li>
