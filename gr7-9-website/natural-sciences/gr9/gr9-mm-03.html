<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1.5 weeks</p>

<p>In this chapter learners will again encounter the reactions of selected metals with oxygen that were used as examples in the previous chapter. In this chapter, however, there will be a greater focus on the actual reactions - these should be demonstrated to the class - and the commonalities between them. Once again, the writing of chemical equations will be scaffolded by the process of starting with a word equation (macroscopic representation) and progressing through a picture equation (submicroscopic representation) to end at the chemical equation (symbolic representation).</p>

<p/>

<p>The content has also been presented in a slightly different order to CAPS in that the example reactions are first explored, and then the general reaction of metals with oxygen is explained, once learners have already seen example chemical equations.</p>

<p/>

<p>In the previous chapter, we learnt how to write and balance equations. The three examples we learnt about were:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>magnesium + oxygen &#8594; magnesium oxide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iron + oxygen &#8594; iron oxide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>copper + oxygen &#8594; copper oxide</p>
</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Which groups do magnesium, iron and copper come from? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Magnesium is group 2, iron is group 8 and copper is group 11. This is important as elements in the same group will react similarly.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>In these reactions, the elements that react with oxygen are all <strong>metals</strong>. If you are not convinced of this, find them on the Periodic Table below in the front of your book. Can you see that they are all found in the region occupied by the metals? Where are metals located on the Periodic Table? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>On the left.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The names of the products of the three reactions above have something in common. Write down the names. Can you see what they have in common? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The products are: magnesium oxide, iron oxide, copper oxide. They all have 'oxide' in their name.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The products are all <strong>metal oxides</strong>. What exactly are metal oxides? As we will see later when we draw diagrams and write formulae to represent these reactions, they are compounds in which a metal is combined with oxygen, in some fixed ratio.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The metals will react similarly with the other elements in the same group as oxygen (group 16).</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We are going to look at two of the reactions shown previously in greater detail in this chapter. Remember that they are not the only reactions of metals with oxygen; they are just the ones that have been chosen as examples.</p>

<p/>

<p>First, we will observe the actual reactions. Your teacher will demonstrate, while you make observations. Afterwards we will write about these reactions using 'scientific language' as we write reaction equations for each one. Before we start, here is a reminder of something we discussed in Chapter 1.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Three different levels of interpretation in science</h1>
<p/>

<p>In the first chapter of Gr. 9 Matter and Materials, we learnt that scientists interpret chemical reactions on three different levels. Those three levels are:</p>

<p/>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the macroscopic level;</li>
<li>the submicroscopic level; and</li>
<li>the symbolic level.</li>
</ul><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p/>

<p>Check whether you still remember what each level refers to, by completing the following table.</p>

     
      <table class="too-large"><tr><td><p><strong>When we do the following:</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>We are operating on this level: (Macroscopic/ submicroscopic/ symbolic)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Observe actual reactions (see, hear, smell, touch, taste).</p>

                
<p>Describe what we see in words.</p></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p>Imagine the behaviour of particles during reactions.</p>

                
<p>Draw pictures of particles in substances.</p></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p>Write chemical formulae.</p>

                
<p>Write reaction equations.</p></td><td><p/></td></tr></table></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

      <table><tr><td><p><strong>When we do the following:</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>We are operating on this level: (Macroscopic/submicroscopic/symbolic)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Observe actual reactions (see, hear, smell, touch, taste).</p>

<p>Write reaction equations.</p></td><td><p>Symbolic</p></td></tr></table><p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Soon your teacher will demonstrate two reactions, while you will be making observations. Which of the three levels will you be operating at? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The macroscopic level.</p>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>The purpose of these demonstrations is to give you a chance to make macroscopic observations of the chemical changes that take place during the reactions. This chapter will also help you to link those macroscopic observations with pictures and equations that you learnt to write in the previous chapter.</p>

<p/>

<p>We will be looking at how iron reacts with oxygen. In some cases, you might use steel wool for these experiments. Do you know what steel wool is? It is wire wool made of very fine steel threads. Steel is an alloy made mostly of iron. So, when we look at how steel wool burns in oxygen, we are actually looking at how iron reacts with oxygen.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>A metal alloy is a solid mixture of two or more different metal elements. Examples are steel and brass.</p>

<p>Your teacher will perform a demonstration in which iron is burned in air. When a substance burns in air, the reaction is called a <strong>combustion reaction</strong>. When a substance combusts in air, it is really reacting with oxygen.</p>

<p>Magnesium is in group 2 in the Periodic Table. Do you remember that we said that elements in the same group will behave similarly. This means that they will react in a similar way. We have studied how magnesium reacts with oxygen, but calcium, for example, will behave in a similar way. You can watch the video in the visit link to confirm this.</p>

<p>To take a photo in the dark, we need a camera flash. Most cameras have built in flashes these days. But, the earliest flashes worked with flash powder that contained magnesium grains. They had to be lit by hand and burned very brightly, for a very short period.</p>

<p>Now that we have made our macroscopic observations of the two reactions, we are ready to write about these reactions in scientific language.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-3">The general reaction of metals with oxygen</h2>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>word equation</li>
<li>picture equation</li>
<li>chemical equation</li>
<li>reactants</li>
<li>product</li>
<li>metal oxide</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>Let us start by writing word equations for the two reactions that we have just performed. Word equations are often easier to write than picture equations or chemical equations and so they are a good starting point when we want to write reactions.</p>

<p/>

<p>Write the word equation for the reaction between iron and oxygen and for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen. </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The word equations are:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>iron + oxygen &#8594; iron oxide</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>magnesium + oxygen &#8594; magnesium oxide</p>
</li>
</ul><p>You can write these on the board.</p>
</div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-4">The word equation</h3>
<p/>

<p>We can write a general word equation for reactions in which a metal reacts with oxygen:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>metal + oxygen &#8594; metal oxide</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>When we use words to describe a reaction, we are still operating on the macroscopic level. Next, we are going to translate our word equation to a picture equation.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">The picture equation</h3>
<p/>

<p>When we represent a chemical reaction as a particle diagram, such as in the picture equation below, we are operating on the submicroscopic level.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idm14226304"><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0006.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>Can you identify the reactants in the above equation? The purple atoms are magnesium and the oxygen atoms are red. Write down the name and chemical formula of the product of the reaction.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The product is magnesium oxide (MgO)</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The picture is not the same for all reactions of metals with oxygen.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-6">The chemical equation</h3>
<p/>

<p>We can go further and translate the picture equation for the reaction between magnesium and oxygen to a chemical equation:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>2 Mg + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594; 2 MgO</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>Since the chemical equation consists of symbols, we can think of this as a symbolic representation.</p>

<p>Can you remember what the numbers in front of the formulae in the chemical equation are called? Can you remember what the numbers inside a chemical formula are called? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Coefficients and subscripts, respectively.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>As we have said, the metals in the same group will react in the same way as each other with oxygen. So, calcium reacts with oxygen in the same way as magnesium reacts with oxygen. The chemical equations also show similarities. The chemical equation for the reaction between calcium and oxygen is:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>2Ca + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594;2CaO</strong></p>

<p>What is the product called in this reaction? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Calcium oxide.</p>
</div>
<p>What group are calcium and magnesium from? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Group 2.</p>
</div>
<p>A metal oxide has the the general formula MO or M<sub>2</sub>O. In the formula, M represents a metal atom and O represents oxygen. We can therefore say that metals from Group 2 will react with oxygen and have the following general equation, where <strong>M</strong> represent a Group 2 metal:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>2M + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594;2MO</strong></p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Metal oxides of the types M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MO<sub>2</sub> also occur, but we will limit our discussion to the first two types.</p>

<p>This experiment will require a place where it can remain undisturbed for two or three days. It may be worth setting up this experiment at the start of this section. Take note: The test tube may be difficult to clean at the end of this experiment.</p>

<p>Rust is a word to describe the flaky, crusty, reddish-brown product that forms on iron when it reacts with oxygen in the air.</p>

<p>When your teacher burned the iron earlier, it reacted quickly with oxygen to form iron oxide. Here is a picture of iron oxide to remind you what it looked like.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0010.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A sample of iron oxide.</figcaption></figure><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-8">Rust is a form of iron oxide</h3>
<p/>

<p>When iron is exposed to oxygen in the air, a similar reaction occurs, but much more slowly. The iron is gradually 'eaten away' as it reacts slowly with the oxygen. Under wet conditions iron will rust more quickly.</p>

<p/>

<p>Rust is actually a mixture of different oxides of iron, but the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> of our earlier example is an important part of that. The rusting of iron is actually a good example of the process of corrosion.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Remind learners of where else they have heard the term 'corrosive' used before in Matter and Materials. It is used to describe strong acids and bases which learners were first introduced to in Gr. 7 Matter and Materials and will look at again later in this term.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Rusting tends to happen much faster near the ocean. Not only are there water droplets, but these droplets have salt in them and this makes them even more corrosive. Rusting also happens more quickly in the presence of acids. Inside laboratories, or factories where acids are used or stored, the air is also very corrosive. When the air in a specific area contains moisture mixed with acid or salt, we refer to the area as having a <strong>corrosive climate.</strong></p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0011.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikebaird/4585328947/"/><figcaption class="caption">An abandoned car quickly rusts and corrodes near the sea. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikebaird/4585328947/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikebaird/4585328947/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>If you live in a corrosive climate, for example near the ocean, it is often better to make the window frames and doors of your house from wood instead of iron and steel, because wood does not rust. Many people also use aluminium as this metal does not rust.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-9">The problem with rust</h3>
<p/>

<p>Rust is a natural process and its effects can be quite beautiful.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0012.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lizjones/449708229/"/><figcaption class="caption">A garden sculpture that was intended to rust to give it more texture. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lizjones/449708229/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/lizjones/449708229/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>However, iron and rust (iron oxide) are completely different materials and therefore have different properties.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Why is rust a problem?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This links to what learners have done in previous grades about the properties of materials.</p>
</div><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Let's imagine we have manufactured something out of iron. What properties of iron do we want to take advantage of? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Iron is a metal, so it is hard, strong and flexible.</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Tools, locks, hinges, screws and nails, garage doors... the list of items is almost endless!</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>When an item is made of iron, we might want to protect it from rust, to prevent it from losing those desired properties. Do you think the rusty chain and door handle in the following photos will be as strong and flexible as when they were new? Why not?</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0013.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/a2gemma/2373078360/"/><figcaption class="caption">A rusted chain. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/a2gemma/2373078360/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/a2gemma/2373078360/ </a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0014.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49889874@N05/4883527730/"/><figcaption class="caption">A rusted door hinge. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49889874@N05/4883527730/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/49889874@N05/4883527730/ </a></figcaption></figure><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>No, they will not be as strong. Rust is a different compound to the element iron and so it has different properties. It starts to weaken the objects.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>You might have learnt in previous grades that iron can be strengthened, and made more resistant to rust, by mixing it with other elements to turn it into <strong>steel</strong>.</p>

<p>Steel is used in the construction of buildings, because it is very strong. Steel is not completely rust-resistant, however, and needs to be protected against rust, especially in moist and corrosive climates.</p>

<p>In the next section, we will learn about the different ways in which iron and steel can be protected against rust.</p>

<p/></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-10">Ways to prevent rust</h2>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>collide</li>

</ul></div>
<p>Rust forms on the surface of an iron or steel object, when that surface comes into contact with oxygen. The oxygen molecules collide with the iron atoms on the surface of the object, and they react to form iron oxide. If we wanted to prevent that from happening, what would we have to do? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>We would need to put something between the oxygen and iron so they cannot make contact.</p>
</div><figure id="gd-idm6769680"><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0017.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-11">Paint provides a barrier to rust</h3>
<p/>

<p>If we wanted to prevent the iron atoms and oxygen molecules from making contact, we would need to place a barrier between them. That is what we are doing when we paint an iron surface to protect it from rust.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idm12693072"><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0018.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>Paint is not the ultimate barrier, though. If the paint surface is scratched, or it starts to peel off, the metal will be exposed and rust can still form.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-12">Other metals as barriers to rust</h3>
<p/>

<p>Rust is a porous material. This means that air and water can penetrate through the rust on the surface of the object to reach the iron underneath. The iron will continue to corrode even if it has a thick layer of rust covering it. So even though the iron surface is covered, it is not protected, because the oxygen molecules can still reach the iron to react with it.</p>

<p/>

<p>There are a number of other ways to stop or slow down rust. One way to protect the iron surface is to cover it with a metal that does not corrode, like chromium, for instance. Taps and bathroom fittings are often made of iron that has been 'chromed'. They have been covered with a layer of chromium to protect the iron surface from contact with the air.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm03-gd-0019.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/a\_mason/3212274/"/><figcaption class="caption">Chromed taps in a basin. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/a_mason/3212274/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/a_mason/3212274/ </a></figcaption></figure><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Ask learners why they think it is especially important for taps in bathrooms and basin to be protected from rust. This is because they are in a moist, humid environment and water makes iron more prone to rust.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Zinc also reacts with oxygen to form zinc oxide:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>2 Zn + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594; 2 ZnO</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>What group is zinc in? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Group 12.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Zinc is in a different group to iron on the Periodic Table. This tells us that it does not react the same way as iron does with oxygen.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) is not a porous oxide, but forms a dense protective layer that cannot be penetrated by oxygen or water. Iron can be coated with a thin layer of zinc in a process called <strong>galvanising</strong>.The zinc layer quickly reacts with oxygen to become zinc oxide. This layer protects the zinc underneath it from being further oxidised. It also protects the iron underneath the zinc from contact with oxygen.</p>

<p>In this chapter we learnt how metal oxides form. We saw two demonstrations of reactions in which metals oxides formed as products. Finally, we learnt about a metal oxide (iron oxide or rust) from our everyday experience as well as ways to prevent objects from rusting, especially those used in buildings and industry.</p>
