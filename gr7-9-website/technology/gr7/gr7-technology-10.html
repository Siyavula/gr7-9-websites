    <b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">design issues</b>.
    Design issues are things to think of when something like a
    cellphone tower, bridge, building or power station is designed.
    They include the purposes of the object or structure, the cost,
    and how people and the environment will be affected.<img xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="medium" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade7_term2-web-resources/image/Tech1_gr7_ch12_NewFig_p_fmt.png" alt="Tech1_gr7_ch12_NewFig_p191.tif"/>
