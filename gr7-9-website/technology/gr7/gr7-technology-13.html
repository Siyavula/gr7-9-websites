    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">In Chapter 1 you learnt about magnets
    and magnetism. Now you will investigate which metals are
    attracted to magnets and which are not. You will also learn why
    it is good to recycle scrap metal and how this important work
    is done.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">We can also recycle materials other
    than metal. Plastic, paper, cardboard and other materials that
    are often thrown away could be recycled instead. Since we are
    running out of basic resources, we need to reuse or recycle as
    much as we can instead of simply throwing things away.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">You will start work on a recycling
    plan for your school by recording the waste produced by your
    school and how much of it could have been recycled. Many
    factories use waste materials, so you can develop a plan to
    raise funds for your school by recycling waste.</p>

    If you said only three, then you are correct. They are steel,
    iron and nickel, and they all contain iron and are magnetic.
    Any metal containing iron and that is magnetic, is called a
    <span class="char-style-override-4"><b>ferrous metal</b></span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Many people think that tin is
    magnetic, but it is not. The tins that you buy food and other
    household goods in are actually made of very thin steel and are
    covered with another thin layer of tin to stop them from
    corroding. Steel is a mixture of iron and carbon. When you
    place a magnet next to a tin can, it is attracted to the iron
    in the steel, not the tin.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Ferrous</b> metals are metals that
      contain iron.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Often, you will see iron that has
    rusted. This is called corrosion. Rusty iron is still
    magnetic.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When a metal is in contact
      with oxygen, it forms rust over time.</p>

    metals to help us with almost everything we do. This means that
    factories need a constant supply of metal so that they can keep
    manufacturing all these items. We use millions of tons of
    steel, aluminium and other metals every year. But the earth's
    supply of metal will eventually run out. Can you think of the

    process of collecting scrap metal for recycling starts when
    people learn to notthrow metal objects away. Everything made of
    metal can be recycled and everyone has to make sure that
    nothing that can be reused is thrown away.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-18">At home,
    make sure that all small metal objects, such as empty tins, are
    collected separately and sent to recycling centres. Bigger
    objects such as old household appliances will be collected by
    scrap metal dealers. Scrap metal dealers sort the different
    types of metals they collect into piles and send these to the
    factories. The factories then melt down the metal objects so
    that <span>the metal</span> can be used again.</p>

    valuable materials that can be recycled, scrap metal dealers
    will pay for scrap metal. They usually pay by mass, so it
    doesn't really matter what shape or form the metal comes in, it
    is the mass that counts.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">But this can create problems too.
    Some people steal metal objects such as steel manhole covers
    and copper wire from telephone and electricity cables, to try
    and make money. Stealing these articles is not only dishonest,
    but it also puts other people in danger. If manhole covers are
    stolen, then there are holes in the roads that people can drive
    or fall <span>into. Stolen electricity cables can cause loss of
    power.</span></p>

    1. Do you think there are metal items that scrap metal dealers
    should not accept from people trying to sell them? Discuss your
    ideas with another learner. Write down the items you think
    scrap metal dealers should not buy.</p>

    recyclable materials</h4>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Scrap metal is not the only
    recyclable material. Most waste can be recycled. There are
    companies that specialise in collecting all forms of recyclable
    waste, and this serves the community in many ways.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">In the last section of this chapter,
    you are going to investigate what a recycling scheme for your
    school will achieve. Before you start collecting materials,
    discuss in the class which waste materials the school produces
    could be recycled. Remember that it is not only your classroom,
    but the whole school.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Get one learner to write these items
    on the <span>board</span>, with a few examples of the materials
    you are likely to find at school.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><b>For example</b>:</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><b>Plastic:</b> milk bottles, cold
    drink bottles.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><b>Cardboard:</b> food cartons,
    boxes.</p>

  <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How much
    recyclable waste is produced by the school?</h4>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  For the
      next week, keep a record of the amount of waste that the
      school produces.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-20">
          It would
        be helpful if the rest of the school knows that you are
        collecting recyclable waste. Ask your principal if you can
        have a special waste bin or small area where
        <span>learners</span> can bring their recyclable waste. If
        your school has extra waste bins, you could put them next
        to the normal bins and put recycling labels on them.

      
      </li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Collect
      the recyclable material and sort it into piles. Put this
      recyclable material into black bags. Tie each bag when it is
      full and mark them clearly. Get advice from your teacher on
      where to store the material while you are collecting it.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Find out
      if there are scrap dealers near you or your school who will
      collect the waste, and ask them how much they will pay for
      the various types of material.</li>

    recycling</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">You have been collecting and storing
    recyclable waste for one week. Now do the following exercises
    as a class:</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Gather all
      the waste you have collected and make sure it is correctly
      sorted: one pile for paper, one pile for cardboard, one pile
      for plastic.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Place the
      piles into bags and mark them carefully according to what is
      in the bag.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Weigh the
      various types of material. Work out the total amount of each
      material that you have.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Multiply
      the weight of the material by the value the scrap dealer said
      <span>he or she</span> would pay for that material.
      <p><b>For example:</b></p><p>3 kg aluminium
      tins at R3,50 per kg: R3,50 × 3 = R10,50</p></li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Total all
      the amounts for all of the materials.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">  Discuss
      ways you could improve the collecting system.</li>

    the waste each day?</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. Where will you

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">5. What scrap dealer
    or recycling company will collect the material, and how much
    will they pay for it?</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">6. Should you bring
    extra material from home or other collection points to add to
    the piles each week to make more money?</p>
