    learn how paper is recycled. You will also learn how to make
    new objects out of old pieces of cardboard. You will make your

</figcaption></figure><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3-">Paper and cardboard are
    materials that are biodegradable. They do not damage the
    environment when they are thrown away. They can also be burnt
    in order to generate heat or electricity, and no poisonous
    gases will be given off. But to make paper and cardboard, trees
    have to be cut off. If paper and cardboard are recycled, fewer
    trees have to be cut down.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-heading">Did you know?</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When 54 kg of newspaper is
      recycled, one less tree has to be cut down.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Almost 40% of municipal
      solid waste is paper and cardboard.</p>
    </div>

      <p class="x--Body-box-heading">Did you know?</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The average person uses
      almost 50 kg of paper and cardboard per year.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Poisonous chlorine gas is
      used to <b>bleach</b>
      paper. To bleach means to make white. The chlorine can form
      poisonous gases called dioxins, which can be released into
      the atmosphere.</p>

    <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="toc-id-5">What are paper and cardboard made of?</h2>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">A paper recycling factory makes new
    paper or cardboard out of waste paper. The way this is done is
    explained below. You can also make recycled paper at home.</p>
<ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-"> Waste paper
    is mixed with warm water and chemicals. It is stirred and
    chopped up by a machine to separate the thin little fibres the
    paper is made of. The machine that stirs and chops up the
    mixture of paper and water, works like a food blender.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-">The mixture of
    chopped-up paper and water is called paper <b>pulp</b>.</p>

    <figure><img class="frame-34" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade8-term2-web-resources/image/Tech_English_LG_Grade8-term2_p126-img1.png" alt="Tech1_gr8_ch9_fig4.tif"/><figcaption>Figure 4 </figcaption></figure></li>
<li>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-"> The pulp is
    poured through a <b>sieve</b>. Old <span class="Body-bold char-style-override-3">glue</span> and fibres that
    are very short pass through the sieve. Long, strong fibres
    remain on top. These fibres then go to a stirred tank where
    chemicals are added to remove ink from the pulp.</p>
    
    <figure><img class="frame-35" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade8-term2-web-resources/image/Tech_English_LG_Grade8-term2_p126-img2.png" alt="Tech1_gr8_ch9_fig5.tif"/><figcaption>Figure 5: A sieve </figcaption></figure></li>
<li>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3- para-style-override-17">
    New glue is added to the pulp. Some clay is also added if the
    recycled paper will be used for writing or printing, because
    the clay gives the paper a smoother surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3- para-style-override-18">
    The pulp goes to a paper-making machine, where it is pressed
    between two rollers to give it the required thickness, and to
    squeeze out water.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">Instead of waiting a
    long time for the paper to dry, it is dried more quickly by
    heating it and blowing hot air over it. Once the paper is dry,
    it is cut into the necessary size and packaged.</p>
</li>
</ol><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above">Paper fibres can be recycled as many
    as seven times. But each time it is recycled, the fibres get
    broken into shorter and shorter fibres. If it is recycled too
    many times, the fibres become too short and weak to use for
    making paper again.</p>

    cardboard, first make a groove on the outside of the cardboard.
    Put your ruler where you want the fold to be, then draw a line
    with a ball point pen. Press hard with the pen, to make a
    groove in the cardboard. Grip the ruler tightly so that it does
    not move while you draw the line. Draw the same line two or
    three times, to make the groove deeper. Fold the cardboard
    along this groove. Fold it all the way over, using the end of
    your pencil to make the fold sharp. Then bend it back so that
    it forms a 90° bend.</p>

    cardboard, first make two grooves on the inside of the
    cardboard. Make a groove in the same way as before. The two
    grooves should be parallel, and 1 mm to 2 mm apart. Fold the
    cardboard along these grooves. Fold it all the way over, using
    the end of your pencil to make the fold sharp. Then bend it
    back so that it forms a 90° bend.</p>

    three folds. Is it a neat fold? Are there any cracks on the
    outside of the fold? Was it easy or difficult to make the fold?
    Is the fold exactly where you wanted it to be?</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-6"><b>Which way of

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Use the cardboard box that you folded
    flat to trace the same design onto a flat sheet of cardboard.
    (See Figure 12) Use feint lines. Once again draw
    the glued tab in the position where it was originally attached
    to the single piece of cardboard.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Do the same as you did to make your
    paper model of the box. But this time, use the best technique
    to make a fold in the cardboard.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">When you have cut and folded the
    cardboard, first test whether it will make a box, and that all
    the tabs are there. If it is correct, then glue the one tab to
    the face to which it should be glued. Use the right amount of
    glue.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">If you have time left in the lesson,
    also do the following activity.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Look closely at the tabs of
      a pill box. You will see small cuts in some of the tabs. What
      do you think is the purpose of those small cuts?</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Make a new cardboard box,
      but this time also make those small cuts.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Design a new box of a different size.
    The new box will be used as a pencil case. You should be able
    to fit two pencils, two pens, an eraser and a sharpener in it.
    You will design the pencil case by using the same ideas that
    you used to make your previous cardboard box.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">First make a rough plan of how the
    development for the box will look. Do this on the next page.
    The rough plan should show all the <span class="char-style-override-3">dimensions</span> of the development.
    Dimensions mean the same as measurements. To draw up the rough
    plan as quickly as possible, make the drawing by hand, without
    a ruler.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Then draw the plan accurately on a
    piece of cardboard, using your ruler to measure and draw
    straight lines. Remember to use dashed lines to show where the
    paper will be folded. Do not cut along the dashed lines.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Go on and make your own cardboard
    pencil case.</p>

      <p><b>Reduce, reuse, recycle
</b></p>
<p>Last week you learnt that it damages the
environment when more and more plastic is made
and thrown away. You can reduce this negative
impact on the environment in different ways.
</p>
<p>Firstly, you can buy less plastic things, which is
called <b>reducing your consumption</b>. Secondly, you
can use some things over and over, so that you
donât have to buy new things. This is called reusing
things.
</p>
<p>This week you learnt about recycling. What if you
have something, and that something gets broken
or you donât need it anymore? Then you have to
throw it away. Fortunately, there is a clever way of
throwing things away, by <b>separating the different
types of waste</b>. For example, if you and your family
collect all your plastic waste separately, then
someone can take that plastic to a recycling factory
where new plastic is made from the old plastic.

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Next week, you will learn where
    electricity comes from. Generating electricity has a negative
    impact on the environment. Burning wood or gas or paraffin for
    heating or cooking, also has a negative impact. You will think
    of ways to reduce this negative impact, by designing a house in
    a clever way.</p>
