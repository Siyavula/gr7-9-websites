    a negative impact on the environment. To burn wood or gas or
    paraffin, also has a negative impact. During the next three
    weeks, you will think of ways to reduce this negative impact by
    designing a house in a clever way.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">In the last few years, the cost of
    electricity has increased a lot. Some people are unhappy about
    this, because they don't have enough money to pay for
    electricity.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Electricity also has another cost
    that has nothing to do with money. This is the "cost" of
    electricity to the environment. Just like the amount of money
    that people have changes when they pay for electricity, so the
    environment changes when electricity is generated.</p>

    lines to see where electricity comes from. When he went inside
    the power plant, a technician told him how a coal-fired power
    plant works. This is what she told him:</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-story para-style-override-37"><i>"In a power
    station, coal is burnt underneath a tank full of water that is
    called a boiler. The heat from the fire makes the water boil
    and evaporate to form steam with a high pressure. The high
    pressure steam blows through a turbine and makes it turn. This
    is very much like the wind making a wind pump turn. A device
    called a generator converts the rotational movement of the
    turbine into electricity.</i></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-story para-style-override-38"><i>The gases and
    smoke from the fire passes through a filter before it goes
    through the chimney into the air. The filter removes most of
    the ash and soot particles, so that there is only a little bit
    of smoke that comes out the top of the chimney."</i></p>
    
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="faside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When a balloon bursts, or
      when there is a puncture in a bicycle or a motorcar tyre, the
      air inside bursts out very quickly and strongly. This is
      because the air inside a balloon and a tyre is under high

    substances that you can burn to create heat and light. Wood,
    coal, paraffin, gas and oil are some of the substances that you
    know about. They are called <span class="char-style-override-3">fuels</span>. All of these fuels
    contain <span class="char-style-override-3">carbon</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Carbon is one of the main
    building blocks from which plants and animals are made. These
    building blocks are very small. It is impossible to see them.
    Carbon is a solid.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Carbon stores energy, like a
    battery. When carbon is on its own, you can say the battery is
    charged. When the carbon is <b>bonded</b> with another small
    building block called <b>oxygen</b>, then the battery is
    flat. Oxygen <span>is a gas. When carbon is bonded to oxygen,
    they are tog</span>ether called <b>carbon dioxide</b><span>. Carbon dioxide
    is a gas</span>.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="frame-75">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">When two very small building
      blocks of a material are close together, they stick together,
      as if they were glued with very strong glue. This is called
      <b>chemical bonding</b>.
      You will learn more about this later when you do chemistry in
      natural science.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-41">Go outside on a
    very cold but sunny winter's day. Let the sunlight shine on
    your hand. Why does your hand start to feel warm, even though
    the air around it is very cold? It is because the sunlight is
    changed into heat, inside your skin. Light and heat are two
    different forms of energy. Movement and electricity are two
    other forms of energy.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-41">When carbon
    bonds with oxygen, energy is released in the form of heat:
    carbon + oxygen = carbon dioxide + energy.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">This is what happens when an animal
    eats food that contains carbon and breathes air that contains
    oxygen. The carbon and oxygen combine inside the animal to give
    it energy and to make it grow. The same thing happens when
    plant material containing carbon burns in air.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-41">To separate
    carbon and oxygen that is bonded, energy is needed. Plants
    separate carbon and oxygen by using the energy of sunlight:
    carbon dioxide + light = carbon + oxygen.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-42">Plants use
    the carbon to grow, because carbon is the main building block
    of plants. They release the oxygen back into the air.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-43">The change
    of carbon into carbon dioxide and thenback into carbon is
    called the <span class="char-style-override-3">carbon
    cycle</span>. This is shown in the picture on the next
    page.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-41">When you make a
    fire or burn gas or paraffin in your house, carbon dioxide is
    released into the air. When you use an electrical stove, no
    carbon dioxide is released from your house. But carbon dioxide
    is released from a power plant that makes the electricity you
    use.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Below is one idea for using

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Bring the food to boiling
      point in a pot on the stove. Then take the pot off the stove
      and wrap it in a thick jacket to keep it very hot. Leave it
      there for two to three hours. The idea is the same as a
      person dressing very warmly on a cold day. To wrap a jacket
      around a pot to keep it warm is called <b>insulating</b> the pot.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The photo below shows an
      insulated cooking box that was used to cook rice. This box
      was made from waste materials. Before the towel was wrapped
      around it, the box felt slightly warm after the pot was put
      into it. That meant that heat was escaping from the pot. So
      an extra layer of insulation was added by wrapping a towel
      around the box. The towel was carefully wrapped around the
      box, so that it covered every part of the box. If some part
      of the box was not covered by the towel, heat could have
      escaped from that part of the box. It took two hours to cook
      the rice.</p>

    compressive forces without breaking. But it cannot withstand
    large tensile forces. In most situations, concrete structural
    members like pillars and beams experience both compressive and
    tensile forces. To make concrete withstand large tensile forces
    too, steel rods or mesh is placed in the concrete when the wet

    rubber is an <b>elastic</b>

    tensile force is applied to an elastic rubber band, it gets
    longer. It also gets thinner.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-1">Dry wood is
    only a little bit elastic, so it cannot get much longer when
    you apply a tensile force to it. Therefore, when the tensile
    force is too big, the wood will crack. You can also say the
    wood will <b>fracture</b>.

    a shape that resists bending very well.</p>

    resistance to bending of an I-beam, to the resistance to

    length between the two supports. And the load is the same on
    both beams.</p>

    will be the same. Which beam bends the most under the weight of
    the load?</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Because an I-beam resists bending
    better, a lighter and cheaper I-beam can be used to carry the
    same load as a rectangular beam. That also means that less
    steel will have to be made, so less energy will be used to make
    steel. In this way, clever design of material helps to reduce
    the negative impact of technology on the environment.</p>

    the lesson, you will investigate <span class="char-style-override-12">why</span> an I-beam resists bending

    to the top and bottom, where there will be more stretching and
