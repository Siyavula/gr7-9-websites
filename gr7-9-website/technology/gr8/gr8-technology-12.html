    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">In this chapter, you will learn how
    to calculate the amount of mechanical advantage lever systems
    and gear systems give.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">You will also learn how to calculate
    the speed with which a gear in a gear system will rotate if you
    know how many teeth each gear has, and the speed with which the
    other gear is rotating.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-text-1-3">In the previous chapter, you learnt
    that you can calculate a quantity to say exactly how big or
    smallthe mechanical advantage is. This quantity is a
    <b>ratio</b>.It is
    calculated by dividing the output force by the input force.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A <b>ratio</b> of 1 to 4 is written as

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">You also learnt that if the
    output force is greater than the input force, the mechanical
    advantage (MA) is greater than 1: MA &gt; 1.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Look at the lever in Figure 2.
    This lever is making the output force bigger, so you can say
    that it is giving us a mechanical advantage. There are two
    "arms" on a lever: the <b>input arm</b> and the <b>output arm</b>. The lever below
    shows the input arm in blue and the output arm in red.</p>
