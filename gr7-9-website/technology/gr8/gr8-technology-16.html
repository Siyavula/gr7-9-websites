    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">This mini-PAT will run over four
    weeks. For this mini-PAT, you should form teams. Each team will
    pretend to be a mechanical engineering company. Each company
    will submit a tender for the design and construction of a
    "mine-lifting system", commonly called "mine shaft
    headgear".</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">The lifting system is used to take
    miners underground and back up again. It is also used to lift
    the mined ore to the surface. After you have designed your
    lifting system, you will have to make a model of it. The model
    will have a mine winch, shaft headgear and a lift cage.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-28"><b>An overview of a mine shaft</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Study Figure 3 on the following page.
    This picture shows a mine's lifting system. The whole lifting
    system is called the <b>headgear</b>. There are four main
    parts to a mine's headgear:</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text"><b>Part 1: The winch or hoist</b> is in
    a winding house. This part of the system is used to wind or
    unwind the steel cable.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The hoist is attached to a motor and
    a control system.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The mine cage and the skips are
    lowered into the mine when a steel cable unwinds from the
    winch.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The mine cage and skips are raised
    when the steel cable winds up again.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text"><b>Part 2: The sheave wheel</b> is a
    pulley wheel that sits above the mine shaft. The hoist cable
    passes over the sheave wheel and then down the shaft of the
    mine.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The sheave wheel reduces the sliding
    friction of the mine cable.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text"><b>Part 3: The head frame</b> is the
    structure that supports the sheave wheel. It must be strong
    enough to keep the sheave wheel in place when it lifts the
    heavy mine cage.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The left "legs" of the head frame
    slope towards the hoist. This is due to the tension in the
    cable pulling the whole frame in that direction. The sloping
    legs prevent the head frame from toppling or falling over.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text"><b>Part 4: The cage and skips.</b> The
    cage is used to transport miners and equipment up and down the
    mine. Attached alongside or underneath the cage are skips.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Skips are used to bring the ore and
    the waste rock out of the mine.</p>

          <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Never play with cutting
          tools. Never point the sharp end at someone else. Keep
          your tools neat and clean and in good working order. Do
          not spill glue or leave the lid open as the fumes are
          poisonous.</p>

    <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Make the steel columns</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">You can make your steel columns using
    cardboard. Look at Figure 7 to help you. You can make round or
    rectangular columns depending on the <b>former</b> you use:</p>

    <figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img class="frame-184" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term3_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch6_fig7_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch6_fig7.tif"/><figcaption>Figure 7: How to make the steel columns</figcaption></figure><ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">If you use a rectangular
      former, you will get a channel. A strip of wood 2 cm
      × 1 cm will workwell for this.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">If you use a round former,
      you can make roundcolumns out of cardboard. A 10 cm
      dowelworks well for this.

        <div class="aside">
          <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A <b>former</b> is a shape that can
          be used to make tubes. For example, when you wrap a flat
          sheet over a rectangular former, you make a tube with a
          rectangular cross section.</p>
        </div> 
      </li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Choose how you will
    make your columns and thenmake all the pieces you will need for
    your model. Have another look at Figure 7 to help you. (1)</p>

    <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Make the cross braces</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-text-1-3">You can make cross braces by
    joining flat pieces of corrugated cardboard together. You can
    use tape or glue to join the flat pieces. Look at Figure 8 to
    help you. Figure 8 shows three types of cro<a id="Anchor-16"/>ss braces: angle irons, T-beams and
    I-beams.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging--1-3-">2. Decide which
    of these cross braces you need for your head frame. Then make
    the cross braces you need. You will use these cross braces and
    the columns you made earlier to make a model of your head
    frame. (2)</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">T-Beams have been used to
      join the vertical and the sloping column.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Cross bracing has been added
      to strengthen the lower half of the frame.</li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Carefully cut your
    beams to the right size and shape to fit neatly between the
    columns. Then glue or tape them on. (2)</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. Cut your angle
    sections so that they can fit across the columns. Trim the ends
    so that the outside of the angle can be joined to the side of
    the column, but remember that the angle has to fit neatly
    between the columns. (2)</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">5. When you are happy
    with your first side frame, make the second inexactly the same

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Look at the pictures shown in Figure
    10. They show two ways to make a model sheave wheel:</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">You can use a round cardboard
      box, such as the ones used to pack cheese triangles.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">You can cut three circles
      from corrugated cardboard and sandwich them together.</li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">For both methods, a plastic straw has
    been used to make a bearing through the middle of the wheel.
    This bearing will make the wheel turn easily on its axle or
    shaft.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">7. Make you own sheave
    wheel. Try to make it as close to the correct scale size as you
    can. Use Figure 10 to help you. (1)</p>

<figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img class="frame-187" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term3_1-web-resources/image/Tech-Gr8-Eng-Term3-p111-img1.png" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch6_fig10a.tif"/><figcaption>Figure 10: Two ways to make a model
    sheave wheel</figcaption></figure><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mount the sheave wheel on an axle and fit it to the frame</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Your sheave wheel has to turn easily.
    It needs to have an axle passing through the centre of the
    wheel. You can use a dowel stick, about 4 mm in diameter, or a
    long nail (about 60 cm long) for your axle.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Look at the picture in Figure 11. A
    sheave wheel has been added to the top of a head frame in the
    following way:</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The axle is taped onto the
      top of the head frame.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The wheel, with a straw
      through its centre, can rotate freely on the axle.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet para-style-override-15">
      <span>Extra pieces of straw ha</span>ve been added to keep
      the wheel in the centre of the ax<span>le.</span></li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">8. Now add your sheave
    wheel to its head frame. Use Figure 11 to help you. (2)</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Will your axle bend? Have a look at
    the axle supporting your wheel. This axle will have to carry
    all the weight of the lift. Does it have enough support? If the
    distance between the axle and the supports are too long, then
    it will bend and might break.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">If you need to, add extra supports
    for the axle at the top of the head frame.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Do you remember investigating crank
    winches in Chapter 4 and in this chapter? Look at Figure 12
    again. It shows you how to make a model mine winch
    yourself.</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The winding drum for this
      mine winch was made from a toilet-roll cardboard tube.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The winch drum has been put
      onto a 2 <i>l</i> plastic
      ice-cream tub. This will be the winch house.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">This winch does not have a
      motor attached. Instead it uses a crank handle. But if you
      have a motor, then you can connect a belt drive or a gear
      system to the winch's drive wheel instead.</li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Here are a few important things to
    remember when making a mine winch such as this one.</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The drum has to turn when the
      crank handle isturned. That means that the shaft that
      connectsthe small wheel with the crank handle to thewinding
      drum must be tightly attached to thedrum, and to the drive
      wheel. You can use glueor tape to make sure that the shaft is
      firmly stuck onto the drum and wheel.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The shaft must be able to
      turn easily in the holes on the sides of the ice-cream
