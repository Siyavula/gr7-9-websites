    current, and its voltage is about 5,8 V. As soon as you connect
    the bulb or beeper and the battery makes a current flow through
    the circuit, the voltage drops to about 1,8 V. This happens
    because the current loses a bit of its energy in the battery as
    it passes through the salt water and all the connections at the
    electrodes. You call this the "internal resistance" of the
    battery.</p>

    input device that you learnt about in Chapter 7. In this
    device, the energy it gives does not come from reactions
    between chemicals. Instead, it gives energy that comes from
    light. This device is called a photovoltaic cell. Photovoltaic
    comes from "photo" meaning "light" and "voltaic" meaning you
    can get volts from the device.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The black parts in this picture
    are a special substance called a semiconductor. This
    semi-conductor substance is made of thin layers, like sheets of
    plastic laid on top of each other. When light hits these
    special layers, the energy of the light is given to electric
    charges in the layers. The positive charges gather on one side

    electrical energy during the day when the sun shines, and this
    energy is then stored in the rechargeable battery. When it is
    dark at night, the photovoltaic cells do not generate any
    electrical energy. But then people can use the electrical

    When you connect the terminals of cells in series, you connect
    positive to negative to positive to negative, and so on. The
    cells don't have to lie head to tail. They can lie next to each
    other. Draw wires between the terminals of these cells to show
    how you would connect them in series.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-opener">You can make a cell using a lemon
      or a potato, with a piece of zinc-coated metal and a piece of
      copper. These cells work in the same way as the cell you made
      in Figure 5. The lemon or the potato plays the same role as
      the piece of cloth or cardboard soaked in salty water. They
      are electrolytes through which certain small ions can move to
      complete the circuit. They are also membranes that prevent
      other, bigger ion, such as the metal ion, from moving from
      one electrode to the other.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Next week, you will learn how
    electricity is generated and distributed around the country,
    and about the environmental and social impact of electricity
    generation.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Read about where electricity comes
    from in Grade 8 Book 1 Chapter 10, on pages 141 to 148. The
    environmental impact of burning coal and other fuels is also
    discussed there.</p>
