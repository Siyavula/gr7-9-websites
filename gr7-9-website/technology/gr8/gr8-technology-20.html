    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">In this chapter, you will learn about
    the various ways in which electricity is generated in different
    types of power stations. You will also compare the advantages
    and disadvantages of different types of power stations.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">You will learn how electricity is
    distributed from the power stations to different parts of the
    country, to reach the people who use it.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">When you switch a light on, where does
    the energy in the bulb come from? You can control the energy
    with a switch, but what is behind the switch?</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">In this chapter, you will find the
    answer to these questions, and find out where the power is
    generated. Before you investigate the country's electricity
    supply, you will look at the ways electricity can be generated,
    and how this affects your daily life.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">South Africa uses many power stations
    for its electricity supply. There are different types of power
    stations: coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, gas, wind and solar.
    Figure 1 shows where in South Africa these different types of
    power stations are located.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">There are no solar-power stations in
    South Africa yet, but plans are in progress to start building
    it.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">You will start this week by learning
    about coal-power stations for two reasons:</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Most of the electricity in
      the country, about 85%, is generated by coal-power
      stations.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">Coal-power stations use the
      technologies of generators and turbines that are also used in
      most other types of power stations.</li>
    </ul><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Generators</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">There are three main systems that give
    us energy for lights, computers, cell phones and all other
    electrical appliances. You can get energy from batteries,
    photo-voltaic panels and generators.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The main source of electricity in
    South Africa comes from large generators. These work exactly
    the same as any small generator you might come across. It is
    important to understand how a generator works as it is used in
    most types of power stations.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above"><b>How a generator works</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-36">If you
    move a magnet near a coil of copper wire, you will create a
    voltage across the end of the copper wire. Look at Figure
    2.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-37">If you
    connect a bulb across the ends of the wire, a current will flow
    around the circuit. To make the current bigger, you can use
    more copper wire in the coils, use a stronger magnet, or move
    the magnet faster.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><figure><img class="frame-136" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig2_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig2.tif"/>

      
        <figcaption>Figure 2: A home-made generator</figcaption></figure></div>


    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">If the person in the picture leaves
    the magnet on the table, how much current will flow in the
    circuit? Your answer can be "a big current", "no current" or "a
    small current". Give a reason for your answer.</p>
    <hr xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"/><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-33">Now look
    at the girl on the bicycle. She is pedalling fast and has a
    generator connected to the back wheel of her bicycle. A bicycle
    generator is also called a "dynamo".</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-38">The dynamo
    gives energy to the lamp only when the roller is spinning. The
    girl on the bicycle has to pedal faster than usual since she is
    transferring some of her energy to the dynamo, which not only
    makes her wheels move, but also lights the lamp.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><figure><img class="frame-137" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig3_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig3.tif"/>

      
      <figcaption>Figure 3: The dynamo on a bicycle</figcaption></figure></div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">If you open a dynamo, you will see
    that it has copper coils similar to the drawing in Figure 2. As
    the girl pedals, the copper coils spin inside the magnets, and
    this movement generates electricity.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><figure><img class="frame-138" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig4_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch10_fig4.jpg"/>

    <figcaption>Figure 5: The exposed copper coils in a dynamo</figcaption></figure></div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Power stations have big dynamos
    called generators. They work exactly the same way as the dynamo
    in the pictures above but are much, much bigger! They also
    require a lot more energy to turn than only one person
    pedalling. In the next section, you will learn the various ways
    energy is provided to these big dynamos.</p>

    <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thermal power stations</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Thermal means "caused by heat". In
    thermal power stations, turbines are driven by steam. The steam
    is formed by evaporating water through a source of heat. The
    water is heated to form high-pressure steam by using a heat
    source such as burning coal or gas, nuclear reactions, or light
    from the sun. The water is turned into steam that drives a
    turbine, which makes an electrical generator turn. An
    electrical generator can also be called an "alternator". After
    the steam has been used, it is cooled down so that the water
    can be used again.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Most of the world's energy comes
    from burning <b>fossil fuels</b> such as coal, oil or natural gas. This results in
    high levels of air pollution, particularly from greenhouse
    gases that contribute to climate change. Fossil fuels will run
    out in the future.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Fossil fuels</b> are carbon-based
      fuels that are taken from the earth, and are made of the
      remains of living things that died millions of years ago.</p>
    </div>

    <figcaption>Figure 6: A
    coal-fired power station</figcaption></figure><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coal-fired power stations</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">The energy conversion process starts
    with the burning of coal that generates heat to convert water
    into steam at a very high temperature and pressure. The heat
    and pressure energy contained in the steam is used to drive the
    turbines, converting it into a rotational movement, in other
    words kinetic energy. You saw an example of this with the
    bicycle dynamo − it is exactly the same
    process. There is a generator attached to the turbine
    shaft.</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Reasons for using coal as an energy source</b></li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">For centuries, coal was the only fuel
    source available in large quantities. Power stations were built
    near coal mines so that coal did not have to be transported
    over long distances.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Most of the coal-fired power stations
    in South Africa are found in Mpumalanga where huge coal
    deposits were discovered. Coal-power stations are the cheapest
    way to generate electricity. It is even cheaper in South Africa
    since the coal here is close to the surface and therefore easy
    to mine.</p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"><b>Impact on the environment</b></li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Burning fossil fuels creates air
    pollution due to the carbon dioxide that is emitted during the
    process. The fires needed to produce steam from water emit a
    lot of carbon dioxide into the air, a lot more than a wood or
    coal fire in your home does. Coal has been used for centuries
    to generate heat.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
    are two other gases emitted from coal-fired power stations that
    have a negative impact on the environment. Newer power stations
    use specific technologies to trap these gases so that they are
    not released into the atmosphere. In the past, when these two
    gases were released from coal-fired power stations, they caused
    "acid rain". Acid rain is rain that contains high levels of
    sulphuric or nitric acid, caused by the water mixing with
    sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Scientists and engineers are working
    on plans to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground,
    but this is expensive and has not yet been done on a large
    scale anywhere in the world.</p>

    <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Topic A: Gas-turbine power stations</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">As an alternative to coal, the water in
    a power station can be turned into high-pressure steam using
    burning gas. Gas is also a fossil fuel, and is normally found
    underground in areas where coal or oil is present.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Gas turbines in South Africa are
    equipped to burn a variety of fuels, ranging from oil to gas.
    Gas turbines have advantages over coal-burning power stations
    because of their design. Maintenance is done considerably
    faster, resulting in continuous availability of power.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Gas turbines are also capable of
    being started without an outside power source, which is very
    important. If the <b>national grid</b> had to suffer a complete breakdown, the gas
    turbines can be started and will generate power to start the
    other power stations.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-2">South Africa
    has only recently started using gas for power stations so there
    is still a supply that will last for many years. Two of the new
    gas-turbine power stations, Ankerlig in Atlantis, and Gourikwa
    in Mossel Bay, both in the Western Cape, are going to double
    the size of their generators in the next few years, adding a
    lot of power to the national grid.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-3"><b>Reasons for using
    this type of energy source</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">As explained earlier, the ability
    to start a power station without power from the same network is
    very important for the national grid. There is still plenty of
    gas available in the world, however, in South Africa only small
    amounts can be mined. After pipes have been placed into a
    <b>gas field</b> it will
    supply the power station without needing to be mined or

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Unlike gas-burning or
    coal-burning power stations, a nuclear power station operates
    using three separate water systems. One of the biggest fears
    that people have about nuclear power stations is that
    <b>radioactive</b> material
    might escape and pollute the air of nearby areas.</p>

    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">It is very important for the three
    systems to beseparate. The first system, the radioactive water
    in thereactor, is in a closed system. It does not come into
    contact with the other two systems and therefore does not
    contaminate the water in these systems. The second water system
    cools down the radioactive steam that has driven the turbines.
    It flows through the condensers where the third water system
    cools the steam back into water. The first water system
    circulates back to the steam generator where it is turned into
    steam again.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The third cooling system for the
    condensers uses sea water at a rate of 80 tons per second to

    and reliable, since electric equipment can be damaged if there
    are changes in the voltage and current.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">It is very difficult to store large
    quantities of electrical energy. The energy provider must
    always match the demand of the consumers. These consumers range
    from households to huge factories, transport systems and the
    use of heavy machinery.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Specific equipment has to be
    installed to ensure that the correct voltages reach the users.
    In this section, you are going to learn about this type of
    equipment.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">As the demand increases, more power
    stations must be brought on line. This means that the power
    they generate needs to be added to the national grid.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">It is interesting to note that
    the electricity demand not only varies from day to day, but
    from minute to minute. The <b>peak demand</b> periods are early in
    the morning and in the evening.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Electricity is transferred from power
    stations to consumers over long distances through the wires and
    cables of the national grid. When a current flows through a
    wire, a bit of energy is lost in the form of heat. The higher
    the current, the more energy is lost. To reduce these losses,
    the national grid transmits electricity at a low current, but
    this requires a high voltage. Remember Ohm's law!</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Step-up transformers are used at
    power stations to produce the very high voltages needed to
    transmit electricity through the national grid's power lines.
    When the electric energy reaches the consumer area, it is
    transformed, which means changed, to a lower and safer voltage.
    Step-down transformers are used locally in sub-stations to
    reduce the voltage to safe levels.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-5">If you don't
    quite understand this, think of water flowing through apipe.
    The wider the pipe, the more water can be pushed through. When
    it reaches the other end, the water is funnelled into smaller
    pipes to be used in homes and factories. The same principle is
    used to distribute electricity.</p>

    <h3>Switches with and-type control (15 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">The circuit in Figure 7 has
    AND-type control. Now let's see where people would use a
    circuit such as this one. Figure 8 shows an electric
    paper-cutting machine that is used to cut many sheets of paper
    simultaneously. An electric motor turns gears that press the
    blade of the machine down to cut the paper.</p>

    <div><figure><img class="frame-172" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch11_fig7_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch11_fig7.tif"/>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">A worker who uses the machine
    could easily cut his or her fingers, so the machine has a
    safety system in place.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">To make the blade come down, the
    worker must use both hands to press two <span>switches at the
    same time. If he or she presses only one switch, the blade will
    not move. So the machine will not work unless</span> <span>his
    or her</span> <span>hands are both out of the way.</span></p>

1 and Switch 2 must both be closed, by pressing
them, before the motor will work.
</p></div>

    
    <h3>Switches with or-type control (15 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-55">The circuit
    in Figure 9 has OR-type control. This type of control is used
    to switch on the light inside a car when you open one of the
    front doors. This is very useful when you get in or out of the
    car at night.</p>

    <div><figure><img class="frame-172" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch11_fig9_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch11_fig9.tif"/>

      
        <figcaption>Figure 9: This circuit has OR-type
        control.</figcaption></figure></div>

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The light turns on when the
    driver opens the door, and turns off when that door is closed.
    If a passenger gets in at the other front door, the light goes
    on again, even if the driver's door is closed.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">So the car has a circuit that
    switches on the light if <i>either</i> the driver's door is open
    <i>or</i> the passenger's
    door is open. This circuit has OR-type control.</p>

   <figure><img class="frame-174" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch11_fig10_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch11_fig10.tif"/> 

    <figcaption>Figure 10: The inside light goes on when
    you open one of the front doors.</figcaption></figure><div class="note">
      <p>A carâs cabin light uses OR-type control because
the bulb lights up if either the switch on the driverâs
door or the switch on the passengerâs door is closed
(on). It also lights up if they are both closed (on).
</p></div>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Look at the circuit
    in Figure 9. Both the switches are open (off). How can you get
    the bulb to light up? Think of three things you can do with the
    switches.</p>
    <hr/><p class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-13">The
    door-operated switch for the light inside the car is the same
    type of switch used for a fridge light, as shown in Figures 5
    and 6.</p>

    <h3>Truth tables (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">A computer gives many outputs depending
    on many inputs. To do this, it uses many AND-type and OR-type
    circuits inside a more complicated circuit. The AND and OR
    parts of the complicated circuits are called "logic gates".</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Computer designers and programmers
    need methods to write down all the possible "states" that the
    system can be in. A state is one possible combination of values
    for all the inputs. "Truth tables" help them to write down all
    the possible states. Computers have millions of possible
    states. But to understand the method of truth tables, you only
    need to understand the truth tables of systems with a small
    number of states.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Look back at Figure <span>8</span>,
    showing the electric paper-cutting machine. The operator has to
    press both switches to make the cutting blade move. So the
    circuit controlling the motor uses AND-type control.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Below is a truth table for this
    circuit. The inputs are the two switches. Each row of the table
    shows one possible combination of the inputs, and the output
    corresponding with it. So each row shows one possible
    state.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Use an idea or ideas from these
    examples to design your own door-operated push switch that is
    on when the door is open and off when the door is closed. Make
    a sketch of your design on the next page. Add labels to explain
    the different parts of your switch design.</p>

         </figure><h3>Make the switches for your alarm system (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">Make two of the door-operated push
    switches that you designed. Remember that they need to fit on
    the doors of your cardboard model of the shop.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Do not make a master switch, as you
    don't have enough time for that. You can simply connect two
    crocodile clips of conducting wires to "switch on" the master
    switch, and disconnect them to open the circuit and "switch
    off" the master switch.</p>

  
    <h3>Add your circuit to your model of the shop (30 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-text-1-3">Now add all your circuit components
    and conducting wires to your cardboard model of the shop. Your
    design of the placement and wiring of the alarm system in
    Figure 13 will help you to connect all the circuit components
    in the correct way.</p>

   

    <p class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Stick the wires to the walls of
    the box with tape to make your model neat.</p>

    <p class="x--Body-indent">Connect all the circuit components.
    </p>
    
 <div class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">In a real building, the
      alarm wires are stuck to the walls <span>or are in</span> the
      ceiling. The door switches are on the <i>inside</i> of the doors. If they
      were on the <i>outside</i>, a burglar could
      disconnect them.</p>

    <h3>Evaluate: test your alarm system (15 minutes)</h3>

    <p class="x--Body-Text">When you evaluate the project, ask
    yourself: "Did I solve Mr Abdullahi's problem?" The following
    questions will help you to test whether your alarm fulfils all
    of the specifications. Do these tests:</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Does the alarm make
    a noise when you open only door 1?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Does the alarm make
    a noise when you open only door 2?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Does the alarm make
    a noise when you open both doors?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">4. Can Mr Abdullahi
    switch the system off and leave the doors open?</p>

    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">5. Complete a truth
    table for the system.</p>

    them.</p>

    make a poster that shows the shop and the doors, some of the
