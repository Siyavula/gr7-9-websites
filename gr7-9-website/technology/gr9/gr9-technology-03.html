    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">In this chapter, you will learn about
    the forces that act on structures and can break them. You will
    see how structures and parts of structures can be strengthened.
    You will also learn about different materials that are used in
    structures, and how materials differ from each other.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">There are many different
      metals, such as copper, iron, aluminium, chrome, gold and
      platinum. Iron is cheaper than most other metals, because it
      is so plentiful. It is also easy to make iron into different
      shapes. Iron is normally mixed with a small amount of carbon
      to form "steel", which is much stronger than pure iron.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Unfortunately, iron corrodes
      or rusts easily, while other metals do not corrode as easily,
      if at all. For this reason, iron is often mixed with other
      metals, for example chrome, to make it resistant against
      rust. "Stainless steel" is steel that contains a large amount
