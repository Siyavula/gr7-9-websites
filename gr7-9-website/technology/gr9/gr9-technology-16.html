      This device has to cut the current very quickly; otherwise

    <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="char-style-override-7">sensor</span> is a control
    device that can have a <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="char-style-override-7">variable effect</span>. A switch can
    only be open (infinitely large resistance) or closed (zero
    resistance), so a switch is not a sensor. Devices such as
    thermistors and LDRs can have different resistances, depending
    on the temperature or amount of light. They can therefore be
    used as sensors. A device that can generate a voltage, such as
    a photovoltaic cell, can also be used as a sensor. A sensor
    "senses" something such as temperature, or light, just as your
    body's senses do. A variable resistor is also a control device,
    but it is not a sensor, because it is a device for which the
    user can <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="char-style-override-7">set</span> the

      do the following project instead of designing and building an
      automatic kettle switch.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">Often when people have to connect
      wiresin electric circuits, there are so manywires that it is
      difficult to know whichtwo wire ends are of the same
      wire.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">It would help to have a device
      thatshows whether two wire ends areconnected or not. This is
      whata "circuit continuity tester" does.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">A circuit continuity tester is
      actually an open circuit. The circuit can only be closed by
      the two wire ends thatyou are testing. Use the two test leads
      of the circuitcontinuity tester to touch the two wire ends
      that youwant to test. If there is a path for current to
      beconducted between the two wire ends, this willcomplete the
      circuit and a light or a buzzer on thecircuit continuity
      tester will be activated.</p>

      </div>
  

   
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">Note that a circuit continuity
      tester cannot tell you whether the two wire ends are of the
      same wire. It can only tell you whether there is a path for
      current to be conducted between the two wire ends, in other
      words whether the two wire ends are electrically connected.
      But if you know that there are no splitting or joining of
      wires in between the two wire ends, then the wire ends can
      only be electrically connected if they are of the same
      wire.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">If you design and build a circuit
      continuity tester as your project, think about the
      following:</p>

      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"> It
        should be easy to let the test leads of the circuit
        continuity tester make proper electrical contact with the
        wire ends.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"> The
        tester should be small.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"> The
        tester should be protected from shocks, for example if it
        gets dropped.</li>

        <li class="x--Body-opener-bullet"> The
        tester should be protected from water, since water can
        cause a short circuit.</li>
