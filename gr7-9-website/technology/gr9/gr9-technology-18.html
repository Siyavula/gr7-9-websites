    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Food begins to spoil the moment it is
    harvested. Food preservation has been part of all cultures
    throughout history. Food preservation enabled ancient humans to
    live in one place and form a community, unlike the Bushmen who
    had to move from one place to another. The discovery of
    food-preservation methods meant that ancient humans no longer
    had to consume hunted animals or harvested food immediately.
    They could preserve some of their food to eat at a later
    time.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">It is interesting that different
    cultures preserved their local food sources using the same
    basic methods of food preservation, for example heating,
    freezing, pickling, canning, salting, fermenting, drying and
    refrigerating.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-15">Food
    preservation is one of the oldest technologies. People ate what
    they grew on the land and what they hunted. They had to take
    good care of their food to prevent it from going off and making
    them ill. They also had to find ways of preserving food so that
    they would be able to eat even when there were no crops to
    harvest or when they could not hunt.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">
      <p>Food preservation is about the treatment, handling
and storage of food to ensure that it does not lose
its nutritional value or quality. An important part
of food preservation is to create conditions that
prevent dangerous bacteria from growing.
</p></div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Grain is a <b>staple food</b> for most of the
    world. Different grains are eaten in different parts of the
    world, for example in China and Japan, rice is the staple grain
    that is eaten.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">In South Africa, wheat and maize
    are the main grains that are grown and eaten. Maize is also
    used to make a fermented drink, a type of beer that some people
    drink on special occasions.</p>

    <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Head-C">Structures for storing grain</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">People have always had some method of
    storing their grain produce. Improvements in storage methods
    have also been observed over time and people used the right
    methods for their situation or need, for example storing grain
    in sacks. Grains produced by farmers who farm as a business and
    on a large scale are stored in "silos". These are huge cement
    or metal structures that hold the grain from many farms in one
    place until it can be used or exported. The silos keep the
    grain cool and free from moisture, insects and rodents.</p>

    <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Head-C">The process of storing grain</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-17">Firstly,
    grains need to be harvested. Small-scale or subsistence farmers
    do this by hand. Figure 6 shows harvesting on a much bigger,
    industrial scale with a combine harvester and a tractor.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-18">Secondly,
    the seed, which is the edible part of the grain, needs to be
    loosened from the plant's casing that protects the seeds. The
    casing is inedible and it is called "chaff". This process is
    called threshing. Figure 7 shows the seeds still in their
    casing.</p>

    <figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<img class="frame-45" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr9_ch8_fig6_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr9_ch8_fig6.tif"/>

<figcaption>Figure 6: Harvesting on an industrial scale with a combine harvester and a tractor</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The third step is called
    "winnowing". Winnowing is the process whereby the loosened seed
    is separated from the chaff. Figure 8 shows the separated,
    edible seeds, and the inedible chaff in the bucket.</p>

    <figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

<figcaption>Figure 7: Wheat before harvesting, threshing and winnowing </figcaption>
</figure>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">There are various traditional
    winnowing techniques. Nowadays, people use combine harvesters
    to harvest, thresh and winnow.</p>

   <figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<img class="frame-47" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade9_term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr9_ch8_fig8_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr9_ch8_fig8.tif"/>

<figcaption>Figure 8: Grain separated from the chaff</figcaption>
</figure>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-17">Fourthly,
    the grain is dried to prevent fungus and bacteria from growing
    on the seeds. The ideal moisture content for wheat is about
    14%.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-17">Nowadays,
    people use grain-drying machines, but in the old days, people
    dried grain with the help of the sun. Figure 9 shows a modern
    grain-drying machine.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-17">Finally,
    the dried grain is stored. The humidity and temperature of the
    air are the two most important factors here.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Warm, moist air will encourage
    bacteria and mould to live on and destroy the grain, even if
    the grain has been dried beforehand. Cool, dry air will help to
    keep the grain intact for longer.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">There are all kinds of insects
    that damage grains, such as weevils and mites. Mites are very
    small insects that eat grains. Weevils are small insects that
    lay their eggs inside the grain. When the <b>larvae</b> hatch, they eat the
    seeds.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Larvae:</b> the stage of an
      insect's life after it's hatched from the egg, but before it
      has changed into a mature insect.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Rodents, such as rats and mice, can
    also cause great damage to grains. They eat large amounts of
    grain if they're not controlled. Besides that, they carry
    deadly diseases that can contaminate the grain and spread to
    humans if consumed.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Now you can imagine that storing very
    large amounts of grain, for instance in a big, modern silo, is
    a complicated job, because air flow and temperature, insects
    and rodents, bacteria and fungi need to be controlled. But
    luckily, storing small amounts of grain is relatively easy. You
    need to put the grain into a clean, dry, airtight container and
    keep it in a cool place that is dry, with no direct sunlight or
    rodents.</p>

    <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" id="toc-id-7">Pickling</h2>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Most food products deteriorate as a
    result of the presence of micro-organisms, such as bacteria,
    yeast or mould. Remember that not all bacteria is harmful. We
    need good bacteria to perform certain functions in our bodies
    and to make certain food products, such as yoghurt and
    cheese.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-15">In the past,
    people had to store fresh food so that it was safe to eat long
    after it was harvested. There were no fridges or freezers to
    stop food from going off. Fruit and vegetables were dried,
    salted, pickled or made into jam so that they could be eaten
    long after they were picked. Dried, pickled, salted foods and
    jams meant that people had a bigger variety of food and
    nutrients in their diet for a longer time.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">
      <p>Pickling possibly originated when food was placed
in wine or beer to preserve it. Both wine and beer
have a low pH level. People then found many uses
for the <b>brine</b> that was left over from the pickling
process.
</p></div>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Brine</b> is a watery mix of
      vinegar and salt. Tomato sauce was an oriental fish
      brine.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">South Africa has a few favourite
    pickles. Achaar is a traditional pickle that was brought to our
    country by the Malay people more than a century ago. It can be
    eaten as a side dish or with curry, and is widely enjoyed,
    especially in the Western Cape. Achaar is made from vegetables
    such as cauliflower, carrots, cabbage and beans, that have been
    finely cut and are mixed together with mustard, turmeric,
    coriander, vinegar and sugar.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">What we know today as tomato
      sauce was originally an oriental pickle sauce for fish. It
      spread to Europe by the spice route, and eventually to
      America where someone added sugar to it. Spices were added to
      these pickling sauces to make tasty recipes.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Chutney is another favourite
    South African pickled product, normally made with fruit.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">For pickling, we can use salt and
    water or salt, water and an acid, usually vinegar.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Vegetables and fish are the two most
    common food types that are pickled. Pickling preserves the food
    because the brine creates an environment where oxygen is not
    present. Thus the micro-organisms contained in and around the
    food cannot grow and multiply and, in turn, cause the food to
    go bad.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-21">The food
    to be pickled is placed in a clean glass jar. A hot brine mix
    is poured over the food and covers it completely. The brine is
    poured until the jar is full. A clean, tight-fitting lid seals
    the jar. Pickles last for many months, depending on the type of
    food.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-21">Pickles
    have become very popular. There are many pickling recipes
    available, and people often experiment with different
    combinations of vegetables, herbs and spices.</p>

    from innovative Dutch settlers from the seventeenth century.
    They brought recipes for dried meat from Europe. They used the
    sun to dry meat during their trek across southern Africa.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-26">Drying is
