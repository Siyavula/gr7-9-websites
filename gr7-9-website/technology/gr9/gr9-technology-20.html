    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">There are two steps to making plastic
    bottles, injection moulding and blow moulding.</p>

    
<h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Head-investigation">Step 1: injection moulding to make preforms from pellets</h3>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-text-1-3 para-style-override-35">
    <span>Injection moulding is used to make plastic "preforms" of
    bottles. Preforms are like small bottles with very thick walls
    that already have the neck and screw-thread of the final
    bottle. FigureÂ 1 shows the preform for a plastic
    bottle</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-35">Figure 2
    shows the injection-moulding machine at different times of the
    injection-moulding process. In this picture, the plastic is the
    coloured substance. The raw material going into the machine is
    small, almost round pieces of plastic called pellets.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">They are initially hard since they
    have not been heated yet, and are shown in blue. The plastic
    must be soft and hot for the injection process to work.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The pellets are pushed forward by a
    screw that is turned by a motor. At the same time, the pellets
    are heated until they melt. The turning force of the screw
    creates pressure that pushes or injects the molten plastic into
    the mould. Once the mould has been filled, the opening of the
    mould where the molten plastic came in is closed, and the mould
    is left to cool.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The plastic in the mould solidifies
    as it cools down. Once it has cooled down sufficiently, the two
    halves of the mould open so that the preform that was made can
    be taken out.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Answer the following question in
    connection with Figure 2.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Find the mould and
    label it.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">2. Where will you put
    a heater on the machine to melt the plastic pellets? Draw an
    extra part or parts for the machine to show where the heater
    should be, and label it.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">3. Look carefully at a
    plastic bottle. You will find a very thin ridge where the two
    parts of the mould joined. If you cannot see it, feel around
    the neck of the bottle with your finger.Why is the mould line
    on both sides of the neck?</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Next, the preform goes to a
    blow-moulding machine. This machine blows hot air under high
    pressure into the preform. This heats the lower part of the
    preform so that it becomes soft and can change its shape. The
    high air pressure forces the walls of the preform to expand
    into the mould, similar to blowing up a balloon.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The same type of preform can be made
    into different shapes of bottles, since it can be blown into
    different moulds. But all the bottles will have the same
    screw-on cap.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-investigation-hanging">1. Why will all the
    different-shaped bottles fit the same cap?</p>

    something is recycled, it means that the output is also the
    input, since the process is a cycle or circular.</p>
