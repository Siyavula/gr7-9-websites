    make a useful new product from old plastic bottles. But first
    you will look at how plastic is used in everyday life.</p>

    Mini-PAT.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">In Grade 8 Term 4, you learnt that
    the environment is damaged when more and more things are made
    and thrown away. You learnt that waste is formed in order to
    make new products, and that the products themselves become
    waste when they are thrown away. You can reduce the negative
    impact of this practice on the environment in different
    ways.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">Firstly, you can buy fewer things,
    which is called reducing your consumption.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-35">
    Secondly, you can use some things over and over, so that you
    don't have to buy new things. This is called re-using things.
    You can also re-use something for a different purpose than it
    was originally made for. For example, many people use old
    hot-water tanks (geysers) to make "braai-skottels" in which
    they can make fire and barbeque food outside.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-35">But what
    if something you own gets broken or you don't have any use for
    it anymore? Then you have to throw it away. Fortunately, there
    is a clever way of throwing things away, by separating the
    different types of waste.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3-">For example, if you and your
    family collect all your plastic waste separately, then someone
    can take that plastic to a recycling factory where new plastic
    is made from the old plastic. At a recycling factory, the old
    plastic is washed and shredded into very small pieces.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">It is then melted and "moulded" in
    the shape of "pellets". The pellets can then be used as the raw
    material to make new plastic products.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">You learnt in the previous
      chapter how plastic pellets are moulded into new shapes.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text para-style-override-6"><b>You need the following materials for this activity:</b></p>

    <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> two or
      more old plastic bottles that have been cleaned,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> a marker
      pen or "koki" pen,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> nails of
      different sizes to make holes in the plastic,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> a strong
      pair of scissors to cut the plastic,</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> sandpaper,
      and</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet"> sticky
      tape to join different plastic parts together.</li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">First make sure that the plastic
    bottles are clean and that all the labels and glue have been
    removed.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above"><b>This is how to cut a plastic bottle:</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">First make a small hole with a thin
    nail where you want to start cutting. Hint: It will be easier
    to make the hole if you keep the cap of the bottle on and
    tightly secured, because then the bottle will not collapse as
    you press the nail in.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Then make the hole bigger by moving a
    thick nail around in the hole to make it bigger, as shown in
    the photo below. You can also use a cutting knife to make a
    short cut where you can then put the blade of the scissors
    in.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-heading">Safety warnings</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A pair of scissors should
      not be used like a knife. If you do that, it can slip and you
      can cut yourself.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Do not try to cut the thick,
      hard parts of the bottle. If you do that, the scissors can
      slip and you can cut yourself.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-51">Once the
    hole is big enough to insert one blade of the pair of scissors,
    start cutting with the scissors, as shown the photo on the
    right.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-51">Use
    sandpaper to make the sharp edges of the hole in the bottle
    smooth so that it can't cut you.</p>
