<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>4 weeks</p>

<p>In Grade 6 learners covered material explaining how the spin of the Earth on its axis causes day and night. They also learnt that the Earth revolves around the Sun, completing one orbit every year. In this chapter we begin by reviewing this material before moving on to look at solar energy and the Earth's seasons. The main aims of this chapter are to ensure that learners understand the following:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The Earth revolves (orbits) around the Sun in one year.</li>
<li>The Earth's rotation axis is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun.</li>
<li>This tilt of the Earth is responsible for the seasons as the Earth orbits the Sun.</li>
<li>The Sun provides energy that sustains all life on Earth.</li>
</ul><p>Learners often battle with distinguishing between revolves and rotates as they confuse the words. If you find learners are battling with this, sometimes it helps to replace the word 'revolves' with 'orbits' so that the concept is clear and the learners are not confused by semantics. We have used the rotate and revolve here, as required by CAPS, but you can introduce this more slowly if you feel the wording is hindering your learners grasp of the concept.</p>

<p>It is important to address any misconceptions that learners may have regarding the cause of the seasons. Some common misconceptions are identified in section 1.1 and explanations are given.</p>

<p>At the end of section 1.1 there is a sub-section that covers the <strong>Seasons on other planets.</strong> It is included as an interesting and challenging extension. However, this section could cause confusion if the learners have not fully grasped why seasons occur on Earth, so do not attempt to include it if you have doubts about learner's comprehension of the previous material. This section is useful however as it helps learners to apply the knowledge they've gained about Earth to the other planets and gives learners a sense of the Earth's place within our solar system.</p>

<p><strong>Concept maps:</strong> The concept maps in these workbooks were created using an open source programme called CMapTools. You can download it from this link if you would like to use it to create your own concept maps.  <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/download/"> http://cmap.ihmc.us/download/</a></p>

<p>The Sun is our closest star. It is a huge ball of very hot gas in space which radiates heat and light in all directions. All the planets, including our home, the Earth, travel around the Sun in orbits. As we will see in this chapter, the Sun is incredibly important: it provides us with light and warmth and its apparent motion across our sky causes day and night and the passage of the seasons.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>It is incorrect to talk about the Sun 'burning'. The Sun is not 'burning' in the way a fire does. Remember, a fire burning on Earth requires oxygen and there is no oxygen in space. Rather, the gas is very hot and glowing as a result.</p>

<p>Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete rotation on their axis and so they have different lengths of days. Venus is the most sluggish rotator of all the planets in our solar system and takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. A Venus day lasts longer than 200 days on Earth!</p>

<p>If you follow the path of the Sun during the day you will see that it rises in the east and sets in the west. The Sun reaches its highest point at noon (midday). Why do you think it looks as though the Sun moves across the sky during the day?</p>

<p>This is an active group activity for the whole class. Ensure that the balloon or ball you use can be seen clearly by all learners. The learners will be standing up and turning around on the spot so ensure that they have enough room to turn without hitting each other or falling over their chairs. If space is cramped it might be a good idea to stack all the chairs away for the activity, or else ten or so children can stand up at a time and move and after that they sit down and the next ten take a turn.</p>

<p>Ensure that the learners know the difference between turning in a clockwise and anti-clockwise direction before they complete the activity.</p>

<p>The Sun appears to move from our perspective, but really we are moving. The Earth is spinning on its axis and the Sun appears to move in the opposite direction from our spin.</p>

<p>As you can see the hanging Sun is not really moving, it just appears to move because you are turning. This is also true for the real Sun in the sky. The Sun does not really move, it just appears to move because the Earth is turning on its<strong> axis</strong>. So, it is the Earth's<strong> rotation</strong> that causes the apparent movement of the Sun across the sky during the day.</p>

<p>So, now you can see how the Earth's rotation about its axis causes day and night. When one half of the Earth is lit up by the Sun, the other half is in darkness. It is daytime in the lit half and nighttime in the dark half. As the Earth spins you move from light to shadow and back to light again over the course of one day (24 hours).</p>

<p>This is a slightly more difficult activity. Ensure that the balloon or ball you use can be seen clearly by all learners. The learners will be standing up and turning around on the spot, ensure that they have enough room to turn without hitting each other or falling over their chairs. If space is cramped it might be a good idea to stack all the chairs away for the activity. Ensure that the learners know the difference between turning in a clockwise and anti-clockwise direction before they complete the activity.</p>

<p>A good way to introduce the concept of seasons is to have learners identify the traditional four seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter). Ask them to describe the differences in weather and environment during the four seasons and ask them about the different activities they like to do in the different seasons (for example going to the beach in summer). You could then ask them roughly how long each of the seasons lasts and at what time of the year the different seasons occur. In a country as large as South Africa the climate varies considerably from place to place and while it may for example be spring-like in Pretoria, it could still be frosty in the Eastern Cape. Therefore, keep in mind that the four seasons (each lasting 3 months) have been defined mainly for temperate regions and the weather expected for "spring" (mild!) might not correspond exactly to the weather experienced in a given place in South Africa at a given time. Discussions in the chapter are therefore 
kept as general as possible focusing on average temperatures in summer and winter for the northern and southern hemispheres.</p>

<p>Before investigating what causes the seasons on Earth you could ask learners what they think causes the seasons and list all the answers on a blackboard, perhaps taking a class vote for each reason. After doing the activities listed in section 1.1 you should ask the learners to recast their votes. It is important that any misconceptions that learners may have regarding the cause of the seasons be addressed and some common misconceptions are explained in the teachers notes in section 1.1.</p>

<p>As the Earth travels around the Sun it receives <strong>solar energy</strong> in the form of light and heat, emitted from the Sun. Do you remember that in Energy and Change last term, we spoke about how heat is transferred from the Sun through space, to Earth? What is this called?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Radiation.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The amount of solar energy the Earth receives is called<strong>insolation</strong> which comes from the words: <strong>in</strong>coming <strong>solar radiation</strong></p>

<p>We are very lucky to have our Sun! if the Earth did not receive any energy from the Sun the Earth would be cold and lifeless. Have you noticed that the average temperature is not the same all year round? We experience the <strong>seasons</strong>: winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is generally much warmer in summer and cooler in winter, why do you think that is?</p>

</div>

<p>ALL the statements in the "What causes the seasons?" activity are false!  The amount of energy emitted by the Sun is the same all year round. Also the Earth spins on its axis at the same rate all year. When it is summer in Cape Town it is winter in Paris and when it is spring in London it is autumn in 
            South Africa. The seasons are reversed in the Northern and Southern <strong>Hemispheres</strong>. If it can both be winter and summer on different parts of the Earth at the same time, the seasons cannot be caused by our distance to the Sun. If that were the case, then the whole of the Earth would experience summer and winter at the same time.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Two common misconceptions about the seasons to be aware of whilst going through this content with learners:</p>

<p><strong>1. Seasons are caused by the Earth being closer to the Sun in the summer and farther in the winter due to the Earth's oval orbit</strong>.</p>

<p>NO: IN FACT, the Earth's orbit around the Sun is elliptical but it is nearly a 
            perfect circle; it is off by only \(\text{4}\)%.  Astronomers have calculated the resulting difference in incoming solar energy: it is only \(\text{7}\)% which is very small and not sufficient to cause the variations in the temperatures associated with the seasons. If this change in distance were responsible for the seasons, then</p>

<p>the Southern and Northern Hemispheres would experience summer and winter at the same time, which is not the case.</p>

<p><strong>2. The Earth's tilt brings the Earth significantly nearer to the Sun during the hotter times of the year.</strong></p>

<p>NO: IN FACT, the tilt of the Earth is the cause of our seasons, but this tilt does not bring us significantly closer to the Sun. The distance from the Sun to the Earth is on average 149 000 000 km and any difference caused by the Earth's tilt is tiny (the change in distance is 
            only about 0.003% of the distance between the Sun and the Earth). This is not sufficient to cause any differences in temperature.</p>

          </figcaption></figure><p>Let us now find out what causes the seasons. The seasons don't just divide up the year into quarters, they tell us where the Earth is in its path around the Sun. Have a look at the following diagram which shows how the Earth revolves (orbits) around the Sun and the different seasons experienced by the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

            positions of the Earth and Sun during the course of a year. It takes one complete year for the Earth to revolve (orbit) around the Sun. It takes six months for the Earth to travel halfway around the Sun.</figcaption></figure><p>Look at the picture showing the position of the Earth as it orbits the Sun during a year. The Earth travels around the Sun in an almost perfect circle. If you look closely, you can see that the Earth's axis is not pointing straight up, but is slanted, or tilted in the picture. This is because the Earth is actually tipped over slightly relative to the plane of its orbit. The Earth's axis always tilts in the same direction in space: the North Pole points towards the star Polaris.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The Earth's orbit is actually very slightly elongated but very close to a circle, called an ellipse.</p>
</div>
<p>What do we mean when we say that the Earth's axis is tilted relative to the <strong>plane</strong> of its orbit? A plane is a flat surface, for example a flat piece of card or the surface of still water. The plane of the Earth's orbit is an imaginary flat surface that contains the Earth as it revolves around the Sun.</p>

<p>Imagine that the Earth is a beach ball floating on the surface of water in a swimming pool with half the ball submerged so that you can only see the top half of the ball poking out of the water. Now imagine that the ball is moving around in a circle on the surface of the water but it is not moving up or down. This is what we mean when we say that the Earth travels in a circle in a plane. In this example the Earth's orbital plane is the surface of the water. In space there is no surface of water, the plane is just an imaginary flat surface!</p>

<p>Now imagine that the valve where you blow up the beach ball is pointing straight up towards the sky. This valve represents the Earth's North Pole. In this case the valve and the plane are <strong>perpendicular</strong> to each other and the angle between them is 90 degrees.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0012.png" width="300"/></figure><p>However, if you push the ball over slightly so that the valve no longer points straight up, then the valve (representing the Earth's North Pole)  and the water surface will not be perpendicular to each other.</p>

            energy from a torch is spread out when the light is shone directly and indirectly onto card. In this activity students will need to shine a torch onto black card. Learners will need to work in pairs so that one person can hold the torch and the other one can draw an outline of the beam of light.</p>

<p>This activity works best when the room is darkened, as it is easier to see the torch light. Some torches produce concentric rings rather than a smooth light distribution. If this is the case the learners should pick a given ring (say the outside one, or the one immediately inside this, whichever is easier to see) and stick to observing this ring in both cases. Learners should find that the direct light is more concentrated (spread over a smaller area) than indirect light.</p>

<p>In which case did the light look brighter? Why is this?</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>Direct. Because the energy from the light is spread over a smaller area, so each unit area receives more energy compared with the indirect case. As the brightness is proportional to the amount of energy received, so areas which receive more energy per unit area are brighter.</p>

<p/>

<p/>
</div>

<p>The energy is spread out over a larger surface area when the light is shone at a slanting (<strong>oblique</strong>) angle  relative to the card than when it is shone <strong>directly</strong> onto the card. Similarly, when light from the Sun hits the Earth directly, the solar energy is spread over a smaller surface area and is more <strong>intense</strong> (concentrated) than when light hits the Earth <strong>indirectly</strong>. Do you think this has an effect on the temperature? Let's investigate.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Direct and indirect light and its effects on temperature</h1>
<p>Scientists often use models to recreate the real world in a laboratory. In this investigation, you will use a model to simulate how sunlight strikes the surface of the Earth. You will use a torch to represent the Sun. You will change the angle at which light strikes a flat surface and see what effect this has on the heating of the surface. This will model how sunlight strikes the surface of the 
            Earth at different angles.</p>

<p>The aim of this investigation is to demonstrate that direct light heats up an area more quickly than indirect light. It is assumed that this experiment will be a teacher led demonstration but with measurements taken by the learners, however, if you have enough equipment there is no reason why the learners cannot set up the experiment themselves. Strip thermometers are often used for taking children's temperatures and are available in most chemists. You can extend this activity if you wish by changing the angle at which the "indirect light" lamp points at the card in steps. Learners should find that shallower angles with respect to the surface produce lower temperature readings.</p>

<p>Ensure that the two lamps have bulbs of the same 
            power installed in them. During the experiment the strip thermometers may become too hot. If this happens turn both the lamps off for about 5 minutes and let them cool down, then start the observation again.</p>

<p><strong>EVALUATION:</strong></p>

<p>How could you have improved this experiment?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>

<p>What do you 
            conclude about the heating effects of direct and indirect light? Why do you think this is the case?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Direct light heats the card more quickly as light is more concentrated and so more energy per unit area falls onto the card. This energy is what causes the heating and so if there is more energy per unit area falling on a surface then there will be more heating of that surface.</p>

<p>Areas of the Earth that are hit by direct sunlight are therefore warmer than areas that are hit by indirect sunlight. In the summer, the Sun is high in the sky and we receive more direct sunlight than in winter when the Sun is lower in the sky and we receive more indirect sunlight. This explains why summer is warmer than winter.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp5711248"><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0016.png" width="300"/></figure><p>But why do we receive more direct light in summer? And why is it always warmer at the equator than at the North and South Poles? Let's do an activity to find out.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Looking at sunlight hitting the Earth</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The aim of this exercise is to introduce learners to the concept that sunlight hits the Earth at varying angles across the Earth's surface because it is curved. At the equator you can see that sunlight hits the Earth almost straight on, this is called direct light. Areas close to the equator are warm as the Sun's energy is concentrated in these regions. As the Earth is curved, not all of the Sun's rays hit it directly. Areas that are hit by indirect sunlight are cooler because the Sun's energy is spread out over a large area. The poles are always hit by indirect light which explains why it is cold at the North and South Poles.</p>

<p>In this example, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere most of the sunlight hits the surface of the Earth at a shallow slanted (oblique) angle relative to the Earth's surface, and so it receives more indirect light. The Southern Hemisphere receives lots of sunlight straight on (directly) and a little also hits at an oblique angle (indirectly) close to the South Pole. As the Southern Hemisphere receives more direct light it is summer there.</p>

<p>This exercise may prove a little harder for the learners as they have to visualise the angle at which the Sun's rays strike the Earth along a curved surface. Encourage them to rotate the book around if needed so that the surface of the Earth is always horizontal.</p>

<p>The light falling on the Equator always hits at angles very close to 90&#176; (almost direct), so it stays almost the same temperature all year round.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0018.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The areas around the Equator are warmer than at the poles throughout the year, as light falls almost directly on the Earth's surface between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.</figcaption></figure><p>Areas that are hit by indirect sunlight are cooler because the Sun's energy is spread out over a larger area than at the equator. The poles are always hit by indirect sunlight which explains why it is cold at the North and South Poles.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Another way to say that the light falls indirectly is to say <strong>obliquely.</strong> Oblique means it is not at a right angle (90&#176;), but slanted.</p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Having discovered that the Earth is warmer close to the equator and cooler towards the poles you could start discussions related to this. For example, why is the world's population distributed the way it is? How long is the growing season for each region of the world? Tundra, Desert, Deciduous versus Coniferous versus Rain Forest. Why?</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>We experience the different seasons because of the varying amount of direct and indirect sunlight we receive. When the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun it receives more direct sunlight (more radiant energy) and temperatures increase: it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The opposite hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun and receives 
            less direct sunlight, it receives less energy and temperatures decrease, so it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun we have the opposite case and it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0019.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The seasons as the Earth revolves around the Sun.</figcaption></figure><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A nice arts and craft activity to reinforce the idea that the tilt of the Earth's rotation axis is responsible for the seasons is to have learners make a poster of the above figure, labelling the Earth and Sun, the equator, hemispheres, poles, tilt (towards, away, neither) and resulting seasons for each hemisphere at each position.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>In the picture above you can see the Earth travelling around the Sun in its orbit. The Earth's axis always points in the same direction in space. Because of this, sometimes the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun and sometimes it is tilted away from the Sun. Let's follow the path of the Earth around the Sun as it completes one revolution from points 1 to 4.</p>

<p>At position 1 the light falls directly on the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5&#176; S). This occurs when we, in the Southern Hemisphere, are having summer, and is called a <strong>solstice</strong>. The day of the summer solstice is the longest day in the year. In the Southern Hemisphere, this is usually around 21 December. 
            At position 3, the light falls directly on the Tropic of Cancer (23.5&#176; N). This occurs during our winter, whilst the Northern Hemisphere is having summer. This is called the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere and occurs around the 21 June. The winter solstice is the shortest day of the year.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Different cultures around the world have various celebrations and holidays around the winter and summer solstices, the equinoxes, and the midpoints between them.</p>
</div>
<p>At position 2 and 4, the equator receives direct sunlight. This is called an <strong>equinox</strong>. An equinox occurs twice a year, around 20 March (when our autumn equinox occurs at position 2) and 22 September (when our spring equinox occurs at position 4).</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The term 'equinox' 
            comes from the Latin words <em>aequus</em> (equal) and <em>nox</em> (night), because around the equinox, night and day are about the same length.</p>

<p>Why do you think it is important to know about the seasons? Think about how people used the knowledge of the seasons to organise their lives and mark the passage of time.  Discuss this with your class and take some notes below.</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

<p>Learner-dependent answer</p>

<p/>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is important that we relate the learning in class to learners' everyday lives so that it is applicable to them. You can have a class discussion on this topic, but learners must also write down their own thoughts. Start off by asking learners what do they think we can learn from learning about the seasons?</p>

<p>Some of the benefits of learning about the seasons relate to indigenous knowledge, such as knowing when to plant crops, when to harvest and when to store food for the winter months. Before people had calendars, they used the seasons to mark the passage of time and know when a year had gone by and the cycle repeated again.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>So you now know that temperatures (and therefore the seasons) on Earth are determined by the angle at which sunlight hits the Earth. In summer, the Sun is high in the sky and sunlight hits the Earth directly. In winter, the Sun is low in the sky and the Sun's rays strike the Earth indirectly at an oblique (shallow) angle. The seasons occur because <em>the Earth's axis is tilted relative to the path of its orbit around the Sun</em> and not because the distance between the Earth and the Sun vary as the Earth revolves around the Sun.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>The reason for the seasons (video)<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EPJ_HUcg8L0"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>Viewed from the Earth's surface, the Sun appears higher in the sky in summer. As the</p>

<p>Sun travels higher in the sky it takes more time to travel across the sky from sunrise to sunset. Therefore, daytime is longer in summer than in winter. The change in the length of daytime during the year also occurs because of the tilt of the Earth's rotation axis in space.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0020.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The apparent path of the Sun across the sky in winter and summer. The Sun travels higher and further across the sky in summer, and so days are longer.</figcaption></figure><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Remember that it is NOT actually the Sun that moves, but Earth's rotation which makes it look as though the Sun moves across the sky.</p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The following questions are challenging and can be used to test the most able learners and extend their thinking.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What do you think would happen to the seasons if the Earth were not tilted by 23.5&#176;, but instead were pointed straight up relative to the path of its orbit?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>You can discuss this with your class. The Sun's path across the sky would be the same all year round and there would no longer be seasons as we know them. It would still be warm at the equator and cold at the poles however. The biggest impact on temperatures would be at the poles. Presently they have dark winters with extremely low temperatures followed by warmer temperatures and constant light in the summer. If there were no tilt, the polar regions would have much more uniform temperatures all year round and the Sun would always be low on the horizon. Across the Earth it would be like it is in the middle of autumn or spring all year.</p>

<p>There would still be some slight changes during the year. This is because the Earth-Sun distance varies during the year as the Earth's orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle (it is <em>slightly</em> elliptical). Currently, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January and furthest away in July. With no tilt, this change in Earth-Sun distance during the year would produce a slight impact on the weather pattern. It must be emphasised that the effect would be tiny as the Earth-Sun distance does not vary significantly different during the year (147 million km in January 2013 compared to 152 million km in July 2013).</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The Southern Hemisphere receives the greatest amount of solar energy around the 21st of December each year. However, the hottest days of the year are generally a month or so afterwards. Why do you think this is?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is because it takes time for the land and sea to heat up or cool down. This is also explains why the seasons change gradually.</p>

<p/>

<p>A year of the sky on Earth (video)<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://vimeo.com/32095756"> http://vimeo.com/32095756</a></p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The video showing a year of the sky is very interesting. Each panel shows one day so there are 360 movie panels playing at once to show the sky over almost a whole year, as recorded in San Francisco. 28 July is shown in the upper left and January 1 is about half way down. The camera recorded an image every 10 seconds from sunrise to sunset. You can see the time going by in the bottom right. This video is useful to show learners how although each day lasts 24 hours, the amount of sunlight changes depending on the season. Although this video is for the Northern Hemisphere and we are in the Southern Hemisphere, it is still very 
            interesting and can be used to demonstrate the difference in daylight hours very eloquently. You can ask the learners why they think the bottom videos (and soon the top videos) are the first to light. This is because it is dawn and the Sun rises earlier in the summer months of June, July and August in the Northern Hemisphere, so these panels light up earlier than the others for the winter months. The initial darkness in the middle depicts the delayed dawn and fewer daylight hours of winter.</p>

<p>This section is an extension which is not required by CAPS, but offers an opportunity to extend your learner's thinking, if you feel you have time in class and you need to assess the capabilities of your learners. Alternatively, learners can read it themselves in their own time.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Do you think that other planets experience seasons too?</p>

<p>Yes they do! Every planet in the solar system has seasons, but they are nothing like the seasons we experience on Earth. Seasons pass very quickly on some planets like Venus, yet last decades on others like Uranus. Unlike the Earth's seasons, which are caused <em>only</em> by the tilt of the Earth's axis in space, seasons on other planets can be caused by:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>The tilt of the planet's rotation axis.</li>
<li>The variable distance of the planet from the Sun during its orbit. This is because some planets have extremely oval shaped orbits around the Sun unlike Earth.</li>
</ol><p>The planets Venus and Jupiter have very small tilts compared with Earth. Their rotation axes are only tilted by 3&#176; compared with the Earth's 23.5&#176; tilt and so Venus' and Jupiter's seasons are hardly noticeable. Venus does have interesting weather however! Venus's surface is a whopping 460 &#176;C all year round because Venus has an atmosphere made of dense acidic clouds which trap sunlight leading to a runaway greenhouse effect.</p>

<p>Mars's tilt is 25&#176;, very close to the Earth's 23.5&#176;. Because of this tilt, Mars has seasons, just like the Earth. As Mars takes two Earth years to orbit the Sun, the seasons on Mars are twice as long. The rotation axis of Mars does not point toward Polaris, our North Star, but points towards the star Alpha Cygni. Because of this, Martian seasons are out of step with the seasons on Earth. Mars also has a distinctly oval-shaped orbit. When Mars is further away from the Sun in its orbit it is cooler, which leads to long, extreme southern winters. The northern winters are not so long and extreme because they occur when the planet is closer to the Sun.</p>

<p>The planet with the most extreme seasons in the solar system is Uranus. Like Earth, the orbit of Uranus is nearly circular, however, Uranus's rotation axis is tilted by a massive 98&#176;. Uranus is on its side!</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0021.png" width="250"/><figcaption class="caption">Uranus.</figcaption></figure><p>Uranus completes one revolution around the Sun every 84 Earth years, giving rise to seasons which last 21 years each! For two of the seasons, one pole is pointed directly at the Sun and the opposite hemisphere does not see the Sun because Uranus spins on its side. The hemisphere facing away from the Sun experiences a long (around 21 years!) dark, bitterly cold winter and doesn't see the Sun until the planet has travelled on in its orbit, to a point in its orbit where Uranus's rotation axis no longer points directly at the Sun.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0022.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The seasons on Uranus: In 1986 the south pole was facing the Sun and so its Northern Hemisphere was in total darkness. In 2028 the North Pole of Uranus will face the Sun and the Southern Hemisphere will be in total darkness. Presently, neither pole is facing the Sun directly.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-6">Solar energy and life on Earth</h2><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>solar energy</li>

<p/>

<p>This section builds on what was done in Grades 4-6 on energy and photosynthesis to expand learners' understanding of these concepts and include the concept that the Sun's energy can be captured through photosynthesis and stored as carbohydrates to sustain life on Earth.</p>

<p>Earlier in Grade 7, in the Energy and Change section, the concept of fossil fuels was discussed with a focus on renewable versus non-renewable energy sources. This is extended here by looking into how fossil fuels were formed and how they captured the Sun's energy for use millions of years later. Learners need to realise how crucially important the Sun is for life on Earth.</p>

<p>In earlier grades energy transfer from producers to consumers, in food chains and food webs, were discussed. Here we look at capturing the energy from its source, the Sun, and storing it for later use. The overarching concept that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred from one form to another, should come through strongly in this section and the next one.</p>

<p><strong>Misconception: The carbon in plants comes from the soil.</strong></p>

<p>This could be used as an introduction to the section. Ask learners what wood is made of (mainly carbon) and where the carbon comes from that a tree is made of. Learners might say the soil (which is incorrect). This could then lead into a discussion of photosynthesis (revision) and how energy is captured by plants. Learners could be lead to discover that plants take up atmospheric carbon from the carbon dioxide air and not from the soil - wood is composed mainly of carbon atoms which come from atmospheric carbon dioxide. This is how plants capture carbon and store it so that human and animals are able to use it. The take-up of carbon by plants is also important as it controls the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (CO<sub>2</sub> is a problematic greenhouse gas when in excess). When plants die and decompose to eventually form coal, the carbon remains in the fossil fuel which we harness later on. The same applies for oil and natural gas.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>So far this term you learnt about how the Sun and Earth interact to form day and night, and the seasons. In this section we are going to look further at how important the Sun is for us on Earth, and more specifically at how the energy from the Sun is essential for life on Earth.</p>

<p>In Grade 6 you learnt how plants produce food through the process of <strong>photosynthesis</strong>. Plants absorb light energy from the Sun and use the energy to make food. In this way the Sun's energy is captured and stored so that it can be used later on.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0023.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">: The process of photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates which are stored in the plant.</figcaption></figure><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Plants also take up minerals from the soil, which are necessary for their functioning.</p>
</div>
<p>In photosynthesis the energy from the Sun is to used to change carbon dioxide and water into <strong>carbohydrates</strong> (for example <strong>cellulose</strong>, <strong>starch</strong> or <strong>glucose</strong>). The carbohydrates are stored in fruits, leaves, wood or bark. When we eat the plant, for example an apple, our bodies are able to release the energy stored in carbohydrates. In the same way animals, for example cows, use the Sun's energy when they eat the grass.</p>

<p>A boy says: 'The energy I get from eating a slice of bread is a result of the Sun shining on Earth.' Do you agree with this statement?

<p>Learner-dependent answer. It is not important whether the learner agrees with the statement or not, but rather what they write in their explanation. A possible explanation could be:</p>

<p>The <u>Sun</u>'s <u>energy</u> is <u>captured</u> through a process called <u>photosynthesis</u>. <u>Wheat</u> plants use the energy to make carbohydrates which they <u>store</u> in their wheat kernels. The wheat kernels are ground to make flour for <u>bread</u>. The Sun's energy is therefore captured in the carbohydrates found in bread, so when the boy eats the bread, the <u>energy</u> from the carbohydrates is <u>released</u>.</p>

<p>All plants and animals depend on photosynthesis for their energy. In previous grades, you learnt about energy transfer between producers, for example grass, and consumers, for example a buck or lion. You used food chains and food webs to show how energy is transferred. Plants play a vital role in life on Earth as they form the basis of food chains. Without plants, life on Earth would not survive. Plants are completely dependant upon the Sun for survival and would die out without its energy which allows them to photosynthesize. Let's investigate this in the following activity:</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">What would happen if the Sun's rays are blocked from reaching Earth?</h1>
<p>Imagine a world without the Sun. How can this happen? It has happened before in Earth's history.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs lived on Earth millions of years ago. They were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates until about 65 million years ago, when there was a massive extinction. There are several theories about what caused this mass extinction. The most supported theory is that a massive asteroid hit Earth. It entered Earth's atmosphere with a brilliant flash of light and crashed into a shallow sea. Huge pieces of red-hot rock and steam exploded into the sky, causing raging fires which destroyed everything in their path. The asteroid's impact also caused giant waves, called tsunamis which swept across the coastal lands. Scientists think that the impact could have started a series of volcanic eruptions. This sent huge clouds of ash and dust into the atmosphere, blocking the sunlight. These huge clouds of ash, dust and steam quickly spread all over Earth and blocked the warm rays of the Sun. Scientists hypothesize that this cold, dark environment could have lasted for months, or even 
          years.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0025.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An artist's depiction of the asteroid impact 65 millions years ago, which scientists think is the most direct cause of the dinosaur's sudden, mass extinction.</figcaption></figure><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="visit">

</div>
<p>Much more recently in Earth's history, there was a supervolcanic eruption at the present site of Lake Toba in Indonesia. This occurred about 70 000 years ago when Mount Toba erupted and sent a huge volcanic ash cloud into the atmosphere. The eruption was followed by a six year long volcanic winter as the ash blocked out the sun's rays, and a 1000-year-long Ice Age. Following the eruption, mount Toba collapsed inwards and today the site can be seen at Lake Toba.</p>

<p>A caldera, meaning<em>cooking pot</em> in Latin, is a large volcanic feature usually formed by the collapse of land after a volcanic eruption.</p>
</div>
<p>Let's now pretend that another event occurs in present day, blocking the Sun's rays from reaching Earth. What would happen to the people, animals and plants on Earth? Discuss this with a friend and then complete the table by writing down the things that you think would happen if the Sun's rays are blocked from reaching Earth for an extended period.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>For this activity let the learners first discuss what they think would happen in pairs. Then give them time to write their answers down. Afterwards a class discussion could follow. Another suggestion is to have the learner discussion at the end of a lesson and then give them the exercise for homework. The class discussion could follow in the next lesson when the homework is checked. The answers to this activity will be learner-dependent, however, some suggestions are provided. The purpose of the activity is to generate discussion and not to have right and wrong answers. The suggestions provided here are based on what scientists believe happened after the major volcanic eruptions (for example, Mount Toba), in the past.</p>

<p>Something else to discuss, which links back to what learners covered briefly in Matter and Materials, is that the atmospheric dust and ash forms poisonous acid rain, which contaminates rivers, lakes and oceans, causing many plants and animals to die.</p>

<p>Earlier this year you learnt about <strong>renewable</strong> and <strong>non-renewable</strong> energy sources. <strong>Fossil fuels</strong> are examples of non-renewable energy sources. In this section we are looking at the relationship between the Earth and the Sun and how solar energy is stored on Earth. We have learnt that plants store the Sun's energy and we are able to use that energy later on. But what happens to the stored energy when plants die? To answer this question we need to go back in time. Millions of years back in time...</p>

<p>This is an optional activity. This video is only 9 minutes long and gives a useful link between the Sun's energy and how it was captured long ago. It gives the conditions for the formation of fossil fuels and explains how coal was formed. Play this video to your learners and let them answer the questions afterwards.</p>

<p>If video facilities are not available in your classroom, try to watch this video yourself and then use it to talk to the learners about the formation of fossil fuels.

<p>Fossil fuels were formed millions of years ago. <strong>Coal,crude oil</strong>and<strong>natural gas</strong> are examples of fossil fuels. The different fossil fuels were all formed in slightly different ways. Let's look at how they were formed.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-8">Formation of coal</h3>
<p>Millions of years ago the Earth was covered with fern-like plants. The plants captured the Sun's energy and manufactured carbohydrates through the process of photosynthesis, just like plants do today. Through changes in the conditions on Earth, the land was increasingly covered by water, forming swamps. Over time the plants died, forming a thick layer of dead <strong>vegetation</strong> on swamp bottoms.</p>

<p>As more water covered the land, sand and silt were washed in and covered the dead vegetation, enabling more and more plants to grow. These plants eventually died as well and more layers of plant material formed. Again they were was covered with water, sand and soil. This process repeated itself for millions of years building up massive layers of dead plant material, called <strong>peat</strong>. The peat layers eventually became buried and compressed by further layers of sediment forming above them.</p>

<p>Deep in the Earth the peat was subjected to pressure and heat, and turned into <strong>lignite</strong>, a porous type of coal. Upon further pressurisation and heating, more moisture was squeezed out of the lignite until it became soft, bituminous coal and eventually anthracite, the hardest type of coal available.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p><strong>Bituminous</strong> coal is a soft coal, containing bitumen, a sticky, black tar-like substance. Bituminous coal is of a lower quality than <strong>anthracite</strong> coal, which is a hard, compact coal with the highest carbon content out of all the coal types.</p>

<p>Coal is found in a number of different areas in South Africa. Study the map to see where the coal deposits are located in South Africa. Millions of years ago the interior of South Africa was a large swamp where many plants grew and died, eventually forming coal.</p>

<p>Oil, also known as crude oil, and natural gas were also formed millions of years ago by processes similar to those leading to the formation of coal. Sea animals and plants died in the oceans and were deposited on the ocean floor. Over millions of years, layer upon layer of marine deposits formed and were covered by sand and silt.</p>

<p>Through the actions of temperature and pressure, the deposits were changed into crude oil and natural gas. Today, oil and gas are trapped under layers of rocks and sediment and have to be drilled and pumped out of the Earth. South Africa has some gas fields off the coast of Mossel Bay, but we do not have any oil reserves.</p>

Crude oil has many uses, but has to be refined first to obtain different a number of different products. These different products have different boiling points, which is how they can be separated from each other. Do you remember that we learnt about this in Matter and Materials when looking at how to separate mixtures? What is the name of this technique where different components, which have different boiling points, are separated by evaporating and collecting them?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>Crude oil  is refined to make a number of different products such as motor oil, petrol, lighter fuel, aeroplane fuel, diesel and tar, Vaseline and other waxes. The components of crude oil are evaporated at different temperatures, starting with lighter fuel (which has the lowest boiling point), then jet fuel, then petroleum, then motor car oil, until only tar is left. When crude oil is refined, some of the raw materials extracted from this process are then used to make plastics and various chemicals.</p>

<p>The correct order is: 4, 1, 3, 2</p>

<p>Millions of years ago ferns and trees grew in swamps. As they died, they formed thick layers of vegetation in the swamps. Rain and rivers washed in sand and soil, which covered the dead plant material. More plants grew, died and formed layers of dead plant material called peat. Over millions of years the peat layers got buried deeper within the Earth's crust, subjecting the layers to high temperatures and pressure. Over time, the peat turned into lignite. High temperatures and pressure squeezed and squeezed more water from the lignite and layers of bituminous coal and later anthracite was formed.</p>

<p>The video resource on the formation of fossil fuels from the activity done earlier in this section (<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pvH-h7TzSsE"></iframe>)   can also be used here to help learners by providing them with a visual picture of how coal was formed.

</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-10">Fossil fuels store and transfer solar energy</h3>
<p>What type of energy is stored in fossil fuels?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The energy is stored in the form of potential energy in fossil fuels.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>When we use fossil fuels, the stored energy is transferred to another part in the system, for example as kinetic energy. We already saw this in Energy and Change last term when looking at how a coal-powered power station works to generate electricity. In a coal-powered station, coal is burned and used to boil water. The steam produced then turns the turbine, which in turn causes the generator to turn to produce electricity. In the next activity we will investigate how the Sun's energy is transferred through fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Using the diagram, explain how the Sun's energy is captured in petrol and used in cars.</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>The energy from the Sun (or solar energy) was captured through the process of photosynthesis by sea plants. The marine animals obtained energy by eating the plants. Millions of years ago the sea animals and plants died in the oceans and were deposited on the ocean floor. They were covered with sand and silt and formed layers and layers of dead matter. Over time, and through the working of temperature and pressure, the remains were changed into crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil was extracted from the ground by mining and refined to make petrol, which is then used to fuel cars.</p>

<p>What transfer of energy takes place within the system?</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>The Sun's radiant energy is transferred to chemical potential energy in the marine organisms and then stored within the oil. The potential energy in the oil/petrol is transferred to kinetic energy when the car moves.</p>

<p>The learners should draw the Sun with an arrow going to trees and other plants with an arrow going to coal with an arrow going to a fire with the burning coal. Each picture should have a label.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>A possible answer could be: The Sun is the source of solar energy. Plants capture the energy through photosynthesis. Ancient plants formed coal which stored the energy from the Sun. When the coal is burned, the energy which was stored millions of years ago, is released. This energy can be used for human activities, for example cooking. In this way the Sun's energy was transferred through plants and coal to be released from the coal by burning.</p>

<p>This stored energy is not in limitless supply. It will run out at some point so we need to be very careful how we use it, and we need to find alternatives to using fossil fuels for our energy supply. Do you think that people on Earth are using our fossil fuels wisely? Let's investigate how fossil fuels are used in our homes.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We also rely on crude oil for many products besides as a source of energy, such as producing plastics, lubricating waxes and oils and other materials and chemicals.</p>
</div><div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">The use of fossil fuels in your home</h1><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>Learners should not only focus on the use of fossil fuels as an energy source, but they should also look at the many other ways that we use fossil fuels in our daily lives, such as our use and reliance on plastics, various chemicals, lubricating substances, etc. This has an impact when talking about our reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Provide some guidelines on the format of the reporting required. You can decide whether it must be a written report, a project to complete over the course of this chapter or term, a poster, an oral presentation, or a combination. You can use the various Assessment Rubrics at the back of your Teacher's Guide to assess learners reports, projects or posters.</p>

<p>If time permits, a general class feedback discussion could follow when the learners hand in their reports. This would close the chapter reinforcing our responsibility to use fossil fuels wisely.</p>

<p>Discuss the formulation of an investigative question in class. Examples are: How much electricity does my household use in a month? How much petrol does my household use in a month? (In this case, public transport should also be included.) What other products do we use at home that are derived from fossil fuels? If learners choose to use electricity as a measure of the fossil fuel use, then they need to clearly state how this is related to fossil fuels, for example the burning of coal to generate electricity.</p>

<p>Look at the concept map below which shows what we have learnt in this chapter about the relationship between the Sun and the Earth.</p>

<p>Fill in the blank spaces to complete the concept map. You need to fill in two of the seasons. To do this, read the concept map and complete the sentence. For example "when <strong>solar energy</strong> falls <strong>directly</strong> on the <strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong>, we have &#8230;...."</p>

<p>There are also two blank spaces to fill in about what orbits what in terms of the Sun and the Earth.</p>

<p>It is important to take note of which direction the arrows are pointing in a concept map so that you know which way to read it. For example, below where we have:</p>
<figure id="gd-idp6189408"><img src="images/gr7eb01-gd-0035.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The arrow is pointing to the left so this reads, "Day length depends on seasons" and NOT the other way around "seasons depends on day length".</p>

<p>What causes day and night? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>We have day and night because the Earth rotates on its axis. The side of the Earth facing the Sun is lit up it is daytime for this side. The side not facing the Sun is dark. It is night time for this side. Because the Earth is continually rotating each point on the Earth experiences successive daytime and nighttime.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The Earth is spinning on its axis west to east (anti-clockwise). The Sun does not move, but it is rather due to the Earth's rotation.</p>

<p>What does sunlight do for the Earth? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>It provides radiant energy to the Earth in the form of heat and light.</p>

<p/>

<p>Why is it hotter at the equator than at the poles? [4 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>As the equator is always hit by direct rays from the Sun it is always warm as the solar energy is spread over a small surface area (intense). Areas that are hit by indirect light are cooler because the Sun's energy is spread out over a large area. The poles are always hit by indirect rays which explains why it is cold at the North and South Poles.</p>

<p>What causes the seasons on Earth? [5 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's rotation axis relative to the Earth's orbital plane as it travels around the Sun. If the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun at a particular point during the Earth's orbit, it receives more direct sunlight. In this case the solar energy is spread over a smaller area, is more intense and thus temperatures are warmer and it is summer. Meanwhile the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun and receives indirect sunlight. In this case the solar energy is spread out over a larger area, it is less intense and thus temperatures are lower and it is winter in this hemisphere. Because the Earth's axis always tilts in the same direction in space, six months later the opposite hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun and the seasons are reversed in the two hemispheres.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">

<p>Explain why the seasons cannot be caused by the change in the Earth's distance from the Sun as it travels along its slightly oval (elliptical) orbit. [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>If the change in distance were responsible for the seasons, then the Southern and Northern Hemispheres would experience summer and winter at the same time, which is not the case. The Earth's orbit around the Sun is elliptical but it is nearly a perfect circle; it is off by only \(\text{4}\)% and the resulting difference in incoming solar radiation is only \(\text{7}\)% which is very small and not sufficient to cause the variations in the temperatures associated with the seasons.</p>
