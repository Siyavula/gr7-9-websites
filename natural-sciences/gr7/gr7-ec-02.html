<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>This chapter builds on the basic concept of energy. The chapter explains the difference between kinetic and potential energy. The law of conservation of energy is also introduced: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be transferred from one part of the system to other parts. This is a crucial concept in Physics and it is important to make sure that the learners understand it.</p>

<p>We have also not made mention of the different "forms of energy" within this content. There is disagreement about what the "forms of energy" are, and how long the list should be or could be. The "forms of energy" language is a problem when teaching learners about energy. For example, learners can be asked to name the "form of energy" in various examples and often learners are just told which one and have to memorise the answer. They are disempowered by the question. Learners are still unable to work out what happens. Furthermore, not remembering the correct "form of energy" can cost them marks in a test, but remembering the "form" correctly does not add anything to their understanding of energy or systems.</p>

<p>What we must focus on is systems which have different parts that learners can examine. It is sufficient to say that the potential energy in a system becomes the kinetic energy of some part of the system. We can have energy in a system in two forms - it can be stored in the system (potential energy) and it can cause changes in the system (kinetic energy). Therefore, the key concepts to focus on within these sections are: potential and kinetic energy, systems, transfer of energy between parts of a system and the conservation of energy.</p>

<p>Renewable and non-renewable sources are where we get our energy <strong>from</strong> but what <strong>types</strong> of energy do we find in the world?</p>

<p>All energy can be placed into two main groups:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Potential energy</li>
<li>Kinetic energy</li>
</ol><p>So what are these different types of energy and what does it mean if an object has potential energy or kinetic energy? Let's investigate!</p>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-1">Potential energy</h2><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Start this section by doing the investigations first and allowing the learners to draw their own conclusions. This will lead them to a better understanding of what energy is and what it can do rather than a verbal explanation. There are several activities which deal with potential energy. If you do not have enough time to do all of them, then choose at least one of them. You can base your choice on the resources that you have available at your school. Do not completely ignore the other activities, though. Take some time to talk through what the outcomes would have been and then you could ask the learners to answer the questions at home.</p>

<p/>

<li>system</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Throughout our investigation and learning about the concepts surrounding energy, we will be talking about systems and how energy is transferred within a system. A system is a set of parts that work together as a whole. A change in one part of the system will affect the other parts. This will become more clear as we see some examples throughout this term.</p>

<p>We are going to find the difference between potential and kinetic energy. Look at the following diagram which shows a ramp with a marble rolling down into a foam cup. The marble will knock the cup and make it move.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0001.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A marble rolling down a ramp.</figcaption></figure><p>When the marble is released, it rolls down the ramp and transfers some of its energy to the cup. This transfer of energy is what makes the cup move. But where did the marble get energy from? Do you think you can make the cup move more or less depending on how far up the ramp you start the marble? Let's do an investigation to find out.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">How can we make the foam cup move further?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is important to emphasise the importance of independent and dependent variables. Take special care to explain the difference between the two variables. The <strong>independent variable</strong> is the variable that you chose to change while doing the experiment. The <strong>dependent variable</strong> is what result you measure in your experiment. Learners would have encountered variables in the previous strands by now. Each group will need a set up and they will roll the marble from different heights into the cup. The higher up the ramp the marble starts, the further the cup will move.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>INVESTIGATIVE QUESTION</strong>: If we roll a marble down a ramp and into a cup, how does the starting position of the marble affect how far the cup moves?</p>

<p><strong>VARIABLES:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>What will we change when performing this investigation?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The height from which the marble is released to roll down the ramp. This is the independent variable because the learners are changing it to see how far the cup moves.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>What will we be measuring in this investigation?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The distance that the cup moves. This would be the dependent variable because the distance depends on how high the marble was before it was released.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>Which things must stay the same?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The size of the marble must stay the same.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong></p>

<p>Write a hypothesis for this investigation. When you do this, you need to write what you expect to observe. It does not have to be the correct answer to the investigative question.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The hypothesis should mention how the distance the cup moves would change if the height of the marble changes. Here are two possible examples:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>"The higher the marble is on the ramp, the further the cup will move."</li>
<li>"The higher the marble is on the ramp, the less the cup will move"</li>
</ul><p>Both of the above hypotheses mention how the height of the marble is expected to affect the distance the cup moves.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>a styrofoam cup</li>
<li>a marble</li>
<li>a pair of scissors</li>
<li>a ramp (this can be a plank of wood or stiff card)</li>
<li>books or wooden blocks to prop up the ramp</li>
<li>rulers</li>
</ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Work in groups of 3 or 4.</li>
<li>Cut a hole in the lip of the cup so that when you turn it over on a table, there is a hole which a marble can now fit through, as shown in the previous diagram.</li>
<li>Build the setup as shown in the following diagram. Place the cup upside down on the table surface. Place the ramp so that it ends at the hole in the cup. Prop up the ramp with blocks or books. You will adjust the height of the ramp using different books or wooden blocks. Otherwise you can just hold the top of the ramp at the specified height.</li>
</ol><figure><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Practice rolling the marble down the ramp and into the cup. You can use two rulers to create a path down the ramp to guide the marble into the hole so that it does not roll off the side of the ramp. Or else you can bend the cardboard so that the marble rolls down the middle on the fold. You can also try a cardboard tube like a roller towel inner. You will need to practice to see what works best with the materials that you have available.</li>
<li>Once you have found the best way to do this, you can start the measurements.</li>
<li>First set up the ramp so that the top of the ramp is at a height of 5cm. Roll the marble from a height of 5 cm and then measure how far the styrofoam cup moves.</li>
<li>Next adjust the height of the ramp by increasing by 5 cm each time. Each time place the marble at the top of the ramp and roll it down, measuring how far the cup moves.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The height of the ramp at each step will depend on what you use to prop it up with. Try and get blocks or books of equal thickness so that at each step the height increases by the same amount.</p>

<p/>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0003.png" width="300"/></figure><ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Repeat the measurements until you have at least 6 recordings.</li>
<li>Record your measurements in the table and draw a graph with a line of best fit.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If you make bigger ramps, you can also perform more measurements at different positions up the ramp.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS:</strong></p>

<p>Record your results in this table.</p>
<table><tr><td><p><strong>Height of marble up the ramp (cm)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Distance the cup moves (cm)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr></table><p>Use the information in your table to draw a graph of the height of the marble up the ramp versus the distance the cup moves. Before you draw the graph, answer the following:</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>Write a conclusion for this investigation. Remember to refer to your graph and hypothesis when writing your conclusion.</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The conclusion should mention that as the height of release increases, the distance that the cup moves increases.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>Was your hypothesis shown to be true or false?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>This answer will depend on what the learner wrote for their hypothesis. If their hypothesis stated that the greater the height, the further the cup moves, then their hypothesis is shown to be true. If their hypothesis stated that the greater the height, the less the cup moves then their hypothesis has been proved to be false.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>When you hold the marble at a distance up the ramp, you are preventing it from rolling down the ramp. This means that the marble has the potential to roll down and knock the cup. So, YOU gave the marble <strong>potential energy</strong> by picking it up and holding it at the top of the ramp. When the marble hits the cup, the marble transfers energy to the cup which then moves. The cup then comes to a stop after a while. Do you have any guesses about why the cup stops after a while?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Discuss this with your class. The cup moves along the surface and it experiences friction as it rubs along the ground. This causes it to come to a standstill. Friction will only be covered in more detail in Gr. 8 when learners look at friction in terms of static electricity and how rubbing objects transfers electrons resulting in a charge. A small demonstration that learners can do to briefly look at friction is to rub their hands together and observe that their hands become warm. When surfaces in contact with each other move against each other, the friction between them transfers kinetic energy to heat.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Your investigation will have shown you that the greater the vertical height of the marble, the further the cup moved. This tells us that lifting the marble to a higher position means that it has more potential energy than if it was released from a lower position.</p>

<p>So the higher an object is above a surface, the more potential energy it has. Think of another example of picking up a brick, as shown in the diagram. Here we are looking at a system consisting of: the arm, the brick and the Earth that pulls on the brick.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp10171120"><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0004.png" width="300"/></figure><p>When the brick was on the floor, it had no potential energy. But when it is lifted up, it has potential energy. Where did the potential energy come from?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The potential energy came from the arm which lifted it.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The boy now lets go of the brick and it falls down to the ground and makes a hole in the sand. What received the energy of the falling brick?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Discuss this with your learners. The answer is the sand which goes flying up. Ask your learners where is the energy now? The answer is the molecules of the sand are moving faster. A sensitive thermometer would show that the sand is a little warmer than it was. Also, the energy went into disturbing the air and your eardrums got that energy when you heard the bang.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Do you think the hole in the sand pit will be deeper if we drop the brick from a higher point? Why?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Yes it will be as it has more potential energy at a higher point so by the time it hits the ground it will be moving faster (more kinetic energy).</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>So what we have seen is that the energy is all still there within this system, but it is not easy to use anymore. The sand is warmer but we can not actually use that energy for anything because the temperature increase was so small. So the energy in the system has not been destroyed, but it is less available for us to use.</p>

<p>Let's look at another example of stored energy and energy transfers within a system.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Elastic bands</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Try to get elastic bands of equal length and thickness. It is the only variable which really needs to be kept constant. If you are running short on time you can leave out this activity. Rather just discuss the conclusions one would draw from such an activity.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">We are going to be shooting match boxes with elastic bands by stretching the bands and releasing them to hit the matchbox. What are the parts making up this system? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The parts of the system are the stiff fingers, rubber band, matchbox, table.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What is the energy input into this system?
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Stretching the elastic band so the movement of the fingers transfers potential energy to the elastic band which is now stretched.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Do you think there is a relationship between how far the matchbox travels and the energy that the hand puts in at each try? Let's find out.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>empty matchbox</li>
<li>elastic band</li>
<li>ruler</li>
</ul><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS :</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Place the empty match box on a desk, mark the spot with a piece of paper.</li>
<li>First, practice shooting the matchbox with the elastic band. Each time, place the elastic band and matchbox in the same starting position and distance from each other.</li>
<li>Once you feel comfortable doing this, stretch the elastic band by a different amount each time and measure how far the matchbox moves with each try.</li>
<li>Place a ruler next to your elastic band and first stretch it by a small amount. For example, if your elastic band is 5 cm long when held pulled tight, but not stretched, between your fingers, then stretch it to 8 cm.</li>
<li>Release the elastic band so that it hits the matchbox across the desk.</li>
<li>Measure the distance that the match box moves across the desk.</li>
<li>Record the distance in the table below.</li>
<li>Put the empty match box back in its original position on the desk.</li>
<li>Repeat the experiment several times but stretch the elastic band a bit more than before each time.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The distances moved will depend on the type of elastic bands used and how rough the surface of the desk is. What is important is that the learners see that the small stretch moves the match box the shortest distance and the largest stretch moves the matchbox the furthest.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Record your measurements in the following table.</p>
<table><tr><td><p><strong>Elastic stretch (cm)</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Distance moved (cm)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr></table><p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">

<p>What did you have to do in order to stretch the elastic band and keep it stretched?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The elastic band had to be pulled hard by the learners and they cannot let go if they want to keep it stretched.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">

<p>Energy is transferred from the elastic band to the matchbox and the matchbox moves. But, then it comes to a stop after a while. Where did the matchbox transfer its energy to?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The matchbox transfers energy to the air and the table.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>When the elastic band was stretched it gained potential energy. We know this because your hand had to do some work to stretch the elastic band, and now the elastic band can snap back and move the matchbox. The elastic band needs energy to make the matchbox move, and it got that energy from your hand.</p>

<p>The further we stretched the elastic, the further it could push the matchbox. This tells us that the more we stretch the elastic band, the more energy is transferred from the elastic band to the match box.</p>

<p>Energy transfers have taken place within this system: Energy is transferred from the hand, to the elastic band, to the matchbox, to the air and the table surface. The table ends up a little warmer than it was as it now has most of the energy and the air has the rest. The energy has not gone, but again it's not available to use.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0005.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A <strong>stretched</strong> elastic band has potential energy.</figcaption></figure><p>So did you notice that both the marble and the elastic band had potential energy? But we didn't do the same thing to give them that energy. We <strong>lifted</strong> the marble but we <strong>stretched</strong> the elastic. This means that there is more than one way to give something potential energy. <strong>Potential energy is energy that is stored within a system.</strong></p>

<p>Now that you understand a bit more about potential energy, can you think of some more examples of things which contain potential energy? Think in terms of things which have the <strong>potential or the ability to change something or make something move.</strong></p>

<p>What about some of the fossil fuels that we discussed in the last chapter, such as coal and oil? Do you think these have potential energy? Yes they do. For example, coal is burned in power stations to generate electricity (you will learn more about this later on in the term). So, we can say the coal has stored energy which is used to generate electricity. Coal has potential energy. This is the same for other fuels as well.</p>

<p>Do you remember making electric circuits in Gr. 6 last year? Do you remember using batteries? The batteries are the source of energy for the circuit. The batteries store energy. In other words, they have potential energy.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0006.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Batteries are a source of potential energy for electric circuits.</figcaption></figure><p>Where do we get our energy from? As we learned in Life and Living, nutrition is one of the 7 life processes. We have to eat food. Food is the fuel for our bodies.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a look at all the small writing on food packaging? The information gives us nutritional information about the food. It also gives us the amount of <strong>energy</strong> stored in the food. Have you noticed that this is often given in <strong>joules</strong>? So what is a joule? How do we measure energy?</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The joule was named after an English physicist, James Prescott<em>Joule</em> (1818-1889).</p>
</div>
<p>We can measure energy, just as we can measure the mass of an object or how fast a car is going. The mass of an object is given in grams or kilograms, the speed of a car is given in kilometers per hour (km/h). In the same way, energy is measured in joules. There are 1000 joules in a kilojoule.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The joule is a measure of energy. A food joule is not different to an electrical joule, nor different to a joule that heats water, nor a joule that comes from the Sun.</p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>At this point it is important to note that the joule is a measure of energy. It is just a number that we calculate after a lot of careful measurements on changes in a system. A food joule is not different to an electrical joule, nor different to a joule that heats water, or a joule that comes from the Sun. It is important that learners realise that joules of energy from food are no different to joules of energy from Eskom. But, if we reinforce the concept of different "forms" of energy, then learners are given the reason to think that energy from food must be different to energy from Eskom, whereas it is not.</p>

<p>The main idea is to simplify the concepts around energy for learners by eliminating the long lists of "forms" of energy that appear in tests and rather shift the focus to systems, which have parts that learners can examine and understand. It is sufficient to say that the potential energy in a system becomes the kinetic energy of some part of the system.</p>

<p>Let's have a look at the energy content for some of the cereals that we eat for breakfast.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Reading a cereal box</h1><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>Encourage the learners to bring in old cereal boxes well in advance of doing this activity. It would be a good idea to find some extras to bring to class for those who forget. You can even photocopy some of the cereal boxes and keep them for the following year.</p>

<p>If you want to extend this exercise you could ask the learners to compare their cereal with the rest of the class. Draw a table on the board with the different cereals and their energies. Get the class to draw a bar graph comparing the energies in the different cereals.</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Learner-dependent answer. For example, a female learner who is 13 and moderately active needs between 8 000 and 9 000 kJ per day.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>What percentage of your recommended daily energy is being supplied by one serving of your cereal? Show your calculations below.</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Learner-dependent answer. Learners must choose the row which corresponds to their age and gender. They must then consider, honestly, how active they would consider themselves to be. They can then use their cereal to calculate the percentage.</p>

        
<p>Example calculation:</p>

        
<p>Lets assume we have a male, aged 15 who is very active. His recommended daily allowance (RDA) would be between 11 00 - 13 000 kJ.</p>

        
<p>A serving of Nestle Milo Cereal contains 477 kJ</p>

        
<p>The percentage of RDA = 477/13 000 x 100 = 3,7 %</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>An additional question to ask learners and have a class discussion is:</p>

<p><em>Based on the percentage worked out in question 3, do you think this is a good cereal to eat for breakfast? Why do you think it's a good/bad cereal for breakfast?</em></p>

<p>The learners should decide whether their calculated percentage is low or high. If it is low, they could decide that it is better to eat a high energy meal for breakfast and then lower energy meals throughout the day, or they might indicate that they are hoping to lose/maintain weight and so a low percentage is a good thing. If their calculated percentage is high, they could indicate that it is better to spread out their energy intake over the entire day rather than concentrate it in one meal.</p>

<p>The nutritional value of a cereal also does not only depend on how much energy it provides, but also what other nutritional ingredients it offers.</p>

<p>There are no incorrect answers to this question. It is based entirely on their own interpretation of their needs. This can be a very sensitive topic, don't spend too much time discussing weight loss programmes as this is not a weight counselling session and learners could get confused between healthy eating and excessive dieting.</p>

<p>Alternatively, ask several learners what the energy content is for their cereal and then ask which one provides the most potential energy and which one the least.</p>

<p>Do you now see why we can say that food has potential energy? We need energy to make our bodies function. We get our energy from the food we eat.

<p>At this level in Gr. 7, it is acceptable to state that the water has kinetic energy as it falls down (as it is moving). However, the water also still has potential energy as it falls. This is because as the water falls, it loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy as potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy. The total energy within the system is equal to the potential energy plus the kinetic energy as energy is conserved.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>What have we learnt so far?</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Potential energy is the energy that an object has because of its position in a system. In the brick activity, the brick had potential energy when it was lifted away from the surface of the Earth. The brick and the Earth attract each other so they are a system. The higher you lift the brick, the more potential energy you give it.</li>
<li>We know that moving objects also have energy, we call the energy of moving objects kinetic energy.</li>
</ul><p>But, we have also seen something else. Think again of the marble activity:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The marble at the top of the ramp has potential energy.</li>
<li>When the marble was released, it rolled down the ramp and knocked the cup causing it to move.</li>
<li>
<p>The marble therefore <strong>transferred</strong> energy to the cup.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We also saw this in the match box activity:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The stretched elastic band had potential energy.</li>
<li>When the elastic band was released, it moved and snapped back and then hit the matchbox and caused it to move. This means that the match box now has energy.</li>
<li>Energy was therefore transferred from the stretched elastic band to the matchbox.</li>
</ul><p>So, the potential energy in the elastic band is not lost. It is transferred to the matchbox. This brings us to our next section.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Law of conservation of energy</h2><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>law</li>

<p>In CAPS, this section comes after the potential and kinetic energy in systems. However, it is more logical to first discuss how energy is conserved within systems and to then look at the examples of the systems in the next section.</p>

<p>Take time to make sure that the learners understand the difference between laws and theories. Scientific theories are subject to development and new ideas are being developed all the time. Learners should be encouraged to see science as a developing discipline and not a static set of ideas. However, the science knowledge that we teach at school level is not in doubt. Most of it has been tested and known since the 1800's. You are encouraged to tell your learners something of the arguments and confusion among the people who were the first to investigate this knowledge, and also that current science in the academic world is constantly evolving.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Law of Conservation of Energy</strong> states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transferred from transferred from one part of the system to other parts. This means that we keep recycling all the energy in the universe all the time!</p>

<p>A fun song about conservation of energy.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/19B2JTi">bit.ly/19B2JTi</a></p>
</div>
<p>Why are we talking about laws in science? Did you think laws were just for lawyers? Well, you would be wrong. In science we talk about <strong>laws</strong> and <strong>theories</strong>.</p>

<p>Scientific laws predict <strong>what</strong> will happen in a particular situation. The law has been tested repeatedly (often) and the results do not change. A law does not explain <strong>why</strong> something happens, it just says what <strong>should</strong> happen. Theories explain <strong>how</strong> or<strong> why</strong> things happen. Theories are also tested over and over again to make sure that they are valid.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Scientific laws and theories are not set in stone, they are just the best explanation for how the world works based on the information we have now. Scientific knowledge is constantly growing and changing as new discoveries are made.</p>
</div>
<p>Now that we know about the Law of Conservation of Energy, this matches our own observation that the energy in the elastic and matchbox example was not lost, rather it was transferred from the elastic to the matchbox. We can say that the elastic band and matchbox form a system. This is also true for the marble and cup example.

<p>We can look at how energy is transferred within different systems to show that energy is conserved. There are many different types of systems that we can look at to see how energy is transferred through the systems.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Mechanical systems</h3>
<p>A mechanical system is one which is based on mechanical principles and the different parts interact in a mechanism. A mechanical system usually involves movement of some kind. It is often a group of simple machines working together.</p>

<p>Do you remember the elastic bands pushing the matchboxes? Do you think that was a system? You are right. It is a mechanical system. The hand, elastic band  and matchbox all form part of a mechanical system. Your hand transfers potential energy to the elastic band, this is the input energy. The potential energy of the elastic band was transferred to the matchbox as kinetic energy. No energy was created or destroyed. We experienced the Law of Conservation of Energy without even realising it.</p>

<p>A swing or a seesaw are examples of mechanical systems.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0023.jpg" width="250"/><figcaption class="caption">A swing is a simple mechanical system.</figcaption></figure><p>Did you realise that when you were swinging on the park swings that you were a part of a mechanical system? When you are at the top of the swing's arc, you and the swing have potential energy because the Earth is pulling you and you are going to start moving down. The <strong>potential energy</strong> becomes <strong>kinetic energy</strong> as you swing through the arc.</p>

<p>What about when you throw a ball up into the air? Do you think this is a mechanical system?</p>
<figure id="gd-idp8603408"><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0024.png" width="250"/></figure><p>When you throw a ball upward it slows down as it moves upwards, stops for an instant and then speeds up as it falls back down to your hand. Your hand moves to throw the ball and transfers energy to the ball which allows it to move upwards. Does this also follow the Law of Conservation of Energy? Yes, it does. No energy was created or destroyed. The kinetic energy was transferred from your hand to the ball which then starts to move. As the ball moves upwards, kinetic energy is transferred to potential energy as it moves further away from the ground. As the ball moves back down again, the potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy.</p>

</div>
<p>When does the ball have the most potential energy?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is important to note that potential energy is relative to a reference point. So, in this example, if we consider the ground to be the reference point, then if you throw a ball upwards and catch it again in your hand, it always has potential energy as it is above the ground. Therefore, the ball has most potential energy when it is at the top of the throw when it stops briefly, before coming back down to the ground.</p>

<p/>

<p>When does the ball have kinetic energy?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>Let's have a look at some more examples.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Identifying energy transfers in mechanical systems</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learner might battle to do this at first, so you can go through one or two of the examples with them, and if possible, also perform the demonstration of bending the wire back and forth. The key is to first identify the parts that are involved and then how the energy is transferred from one part to another within the system.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>a piece of wire</li>
</ul><p>We are first going to perform a simple demonstration to identify the energy transfers within mechanical systems. Take a length of wire and touch it to your lips. How does it feel?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners should note that the wire feels cold.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Then, bend the wire into a U-shape and bend it back and forth 10 times quickly. Now, feel the temperature again at the bend. How does it feel?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners should note that it feels warm.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>This is an example of a mechanical system. We can describe the transfer of energy as the potential energy within your arms is transferred to kinetic energy as you move them back and forth. This is transferred to kinetic energy in the wire which is then transferred to the lips as heat.</p>

<p>We will learn more about how particles behave next year when we look at the particle model of matter.</p>
</div>
<p>Did you know that the particles that make up a substance or object, such as atoms or molecules, also have kinetic energy? Particles which have more kinetic energy will move faster than particles which have less kinetic energy. When the particles are moving very fast, we feel the substance and say "That's hot!". This is because the temperature of a substance depends on the kinetic energy of the particles.</p>

<p>The thermal energy can be transferred from one object to another in a thermal system. When thermal energy is transferred, this is called heat. We will look more at this in the next chapter, but for now let's look at some simple examples of energy transfers within thermal systems (heating).</p>

</div><div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">The energy transfers when boiling water</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This investigation works best with water placed in a beaker and heated over a Bunsen burner using a tripod. However, if you don't have a Bunsen burner you can use a candle and a tin can. The candle will not provide a large amount of heat energy and so you should use a small amount of water in order for it to reach boiling point within the lesson time. Remember to use an alcohol thermometer rather than a mercury thermometer.</p>

<p>Although this may seem like a very simple investigation, and learners have heated water before, the focus here is different in that we are investigating the energy transfers. This is also an opportunity for learners to practice recording, observing and translation skills, such as drawing a graph.</p>

<p/>

<p>What happens to the temperature of water when it is heated over a flame?</p>

<p>The amount/volume of the water must be kept constant</p>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong></p>

<p>Write a hypothesis for this investigation. (Hint: What do you think will happen to the temperature of the water. Will it go up or down?)</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The hypothesis should mention how the dependent variable would change with a change in the independent variable and should mention which variables must remain constant. In this investigation a suitable hypothesis could read: 'The temperature of the water will increase as time increases if the amount of water is kept constant' or 'The temperature of the water will decrease as time increases if the amount of water is kept constant.'</p>

<p>Remember that a hypothesis doesn't have to be correct. It is a prediction made before any investigation is done and so the outcome is not necessarily known beforehand. Do not discourage learners from developing their own hypotheses. Emphasise that a hypothesis is just as valuable if it is rejected after the investigation.</p>

<p>The reason we do a boiling point curve like this is so that the learners can see that the curve flattens out and temperature remains constant. This is how we find the boiling point of a liquid. It is useful to do a boiling point curve of another liquid as well, such as Coca Cola or orange/apple juice to get a similar shaped curve so that learners understand that at boiling point of that liquid the temperature remains constant for while. If you leave it longer still the temperature will begin to fall as more water particles move into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>So, what have we discovered? The temperature of the water increased. This means that the water particles must have been given more <strong>kinetic energy</strong>. The energy must have come from the Bunsen burner flame. The flame is there because we are burning gas so the energy must have been stored in the gas. If it is stored energy then it is <strong>potential energy</strong>.</p>

<p>An electric circuit is a system as it consists of different parts that do something, ie. make the light bulb glow. Ask learners to identify the different parts in this system. They are: the battery, the light bulb, the switch (paperclip) and the conducting wires.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What is the source of energy is this electric circuit? In other words, what is the input energy in this system?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>The battery is the source of energy, potential energy is the input energy in this system.</p>

<p>Do you know that we also get biological systems? You have come across these types of systems before in Life and Living, but now we are going to talk about them in terms of how the energy is transferred within these systems, and conserved.</p>

<p>Do you remember learning about photosynthesis and food chains in Life and Living? This is an example of a biological system. Let's find out why.</p>

<p>A plant uses the radiant energy from the Sun to make its own food through the process of photosynthesis. The energy from the Sun is stored as potential energy in plants, mainly as starch. Have a look at the following image to remind you.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp9537264"><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0033.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p>What process is being shown in the diagram? Write a sentence to describe the requirements for this process.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The diagram is showing photosynthesis. The plant uses water, carbon dioxide and sunlight energy to produce glucose and oxygen.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>When an animal eats the plant it uses the potential energy in the food which is released during respiration. This is then used by the animal to move and for all its life processes. So the potential energy in the food which the animal eats is transferred to kinetic energy. Energy has been transferred from the Sun to the plant to the animal.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0034.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An impala eats the grass and stores the energy in its muscles. When the impala runs, the stored energy becomes kinetic energy.</figcaption></figure><p>When we eat plants or animals we are able to use the stored potential energy to make our bodies function.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec02-gd-0035.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Our food provides the input energy for our bodies to work and move. The food contains potential energy.</figcaption></figure><p>Is the energy conserved in a biological system? Yes, it is! The plants change the Sun's energy into <strong>potential</strong> energy which it stores inside itself. Animals then eat the plants and the stored potential energy is transferred to them. The animals use the stored energy to enable them to move. This means the potential energy within the animal has been transferred kinetic energy. As the animal moves and performs its functions, this kinetic energy is transferred to the surroundings. No energy has been created or destroyed, just transferred from the Sun to the plant to the animal.</p>

<p>Let's revise the energy transfers within some systems by studying and drawing flow diagrams.</p>

<p>In the previous example showing the berries, the bird and the cat, we saw an example of a food chain. Do you remember learning about food chains in Gr. 6? A food chain only shows the transfer of energy between organisms, and does not include the Sun. So, it always starts with a producer. Is the image below an example of a food chain? Why or why not?</p>
