<p>Chapter overview</p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>In the last chapter we looked at thermal systems which transfer energy. This chapter expands on this and looks at the different ways that thermal energy is transferred between different objects.</p>

<p>It is important to understand the difference between heat, as a concept, and temperature. Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold an object is; it is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles of a substance. Heat is the energy transferred between two objects as a consequence of the temperature difference between them. It is also true when energy is transferred between a system and the environment as a consequence of the temperature difference between them. Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius (&#176;C) or degrees Kelvin (K) while heat is measured in joules (J).</p>

<p>In the last chapter we looked at thermal systems. The thermal energy of an object is the amount of energy it has inside of it, in other words, its internal energy. In a thermal system, thermal energy is transferred from one object to another. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy from a system to its surroundings or from one object to another. This transfer of energy is from the object at a higher temperature to the object at a lower temperature.</p>

<p>It is very important to know that, in science, heat and temperature are not the same thing.</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><strong>Heat</strong> is the transfer of thermal energy from a system to its surroundings or from one object to another as a result of a difference in temperature. Heat is measured in joules (J). This is because heat is a transfer of energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temperature</strong> is a measure of how hot or cold a substance feels and it is measured in degrees Celsius (&#176;C). Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in an object or system. We use a thermometer to measure the temperature of an object or substance.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Complete the following table to summarize the differences between heat and temperature</p>

<p>Heat is the transfer of energy. During energy transfer, the energy moves from the hotter object to the colder object. This means that the hotter object will cool down and the colder object will warm up. The energy transfer will continue until both objects are at the same temperature.</p>

<p>There are 3 ways in which thermal energy can be transferred from one object/substance to another, or from a system to its surroundings:</p>

</div>
<p>Let's have a look at these in more detail.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-2">Conduction</h2><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>conduction</li>

</ul></div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A suggestion to introduce this topic is to ask learners what happens to a metal teaspoon when they put it in their hot beverage. If possible, demonstrate this briefly in class, even with a hot glass of water and a metal rod. In addition, use a plastic teaspoon to demonstrate the difference as plastic is an insulator.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Have you noticed that when you put a cold, metal teaspoon into your hot cup of tea, the teaspoon handle also warms up after a while? Have you ever wondered how this warmth "moved" from the hot tea to the cold teaspoon and warmed it up? This is one way in which energy is transferred and this is called <strong>conduction</strong>. Let's find out how it works.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec03-gd-0001.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">How does the handle of the metal teaspoon become hot when in a cup of tea?</figcaption></figure><p>When energy is transferred to an object, the energy of the particles increases. This means the particles have more kinetic energy and they start to move and vibrate faster. As the particles are moving faster they "bump" into other particles and transfer some of their energy to those neighbouring particles. In this way, the energy is transferred through the substance to the other end. This process is called <strong>conduction</strong>. The particles conduct the energy through the substance, as shown in the diagram.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp26812592"><img src="images/gr7ec03-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Let's demonstrate this practically.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Conduction through a metal rod</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Set this demonstration up in front of the class as you start to talk about conduction.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Bunsen burner</li>

<p/>

<p>As an extension exercise you could include another investigation in which you measure the rate of energy conduction along a metal rod. Repeat the experiment placing drawing pins at 5cm intervals on a long metal rod. Clamp the metal rod and heat one end over a Bunsen burner. Use a stopwatch to time how long it takes for each drawing pin to drop and record the results on a graph. This could be further extended by using different metals and putting all the results on a single set of axes. The gradient of the graphs would give the rate of heat conduction.</p>

<p>Let's think about the teaspoon in the tea again. The tea is hot and the metal spoon is cold. When you put the metal teaspoon into the hot tea some of the thermal energy from the tea is transferred to the metal particles. The metal particles start to vibrate faster and collide with their neighbouring particles. These collisions spread the thermal energy up through the teaspoon. This makes the handle of the teaspoon feel hot.</p>

<p>Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between objects that are touching. In the teaspoon example, the particles of the tea are touching the particles of the metal spoon, which in turn are touching each other, and this is how heat is conducted from one object to the other.</p>

<p>Do all materials conduct heat in the same way? Let's find out.</p>

<p>Misconceptions about temperature. Why do you think your carpet feels warmer than tiles in winter? Watch this video to find out.<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vqDbMEdLiCs"></iframe></p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In response to the video in the margin box about why your carpet feels warmer than the tiles in winter, you can come back to this question after you have performed the following investigation, and also looked at the example of the cake tin and the cake straight out of the oven. You can lead the discussion in the following way:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Start off by asking learners why they would prefer to stand on a carpet in winter rather than the tiles. They would probably answer that the carpet feels warmer.</li>
<li>Follow this up by asking them what they think the temperatures of each surface is. Learners might say that they think the tiles are at a lower temperature than the carpet because it feels colder. This is incorrect as the tiles and the carpet will be at the same temperature as they have both been in the same environment for a while and so will be at the same temperature.</li>
<li>However, if you pose this question to learners again after doing the following investigation and also after looking at the cake and cake tin example, they might then realise that this is another example of a difference in conductivity.</li>
<li>Namely, the tiles and the carpet are both at the same temperature, but the tiles are a better conductor of energy and so they conduct heat at a faster rate away from your feet than the carpet would, making the tiles feel colder, when in actual fact they are at the same temperature.</li>
</ul><p/>
</div><div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Do all materials conduct heat in the same way?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This investigation will show the learners that metals conduct heat better than non-metals. If possible, watch the Veritasium video provided in the visit link before class about the misconceptions surrounding temperature and which demonstrates this activity. Start off by asking learners to feel the blocks and ask which one feels colder. The aluminium block will feel colder. Then ask them which block they think will melt the ice cube the fastest. as in the video, most people think that the ice cube will melt faster on the plastic block as it feels warmer than the aluminium block. However, this is a misconception, and will be demonstrated in the activity that it is in fact the aluminium block which causes the ice cube to melt faster as metals are a better conductors of heat.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To investigate which materials are the best conductors of heat.</p>

<p>In this investigation, we will be placing an ice cube on a plastic block and on an aluminium block and observing which ice cube melts the fastest.</p>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong> Write a hypothesis for this investigation. Which block do you think will melt the ice cube the fastest?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners might hypothesize that the ice cube will melt faster on the plastic than the aluminium block. If they do, make sure that they come back to reject their hypothesis and revise it.</p>

<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>a plastic block</li>
<li>an aluminium block</li>

<p>You can use any piece of plastic and aluminium (or other metal) that you can find. if possible, use a circular ring to stop the melted water from spilling.</p>

<p>Learner-dependent answer. Most people generally have the misconception that the ice cube will melt faster on the plastic block, rather than the metal block.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What can you conclude about which material (the plastic or the metal) is the best conductor of heat?
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Metal is a better conductor of heat than plastic as the ice cube on the metal melted first.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>We will discuss this in the next paragraph about why this happens.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>So how does this work? This is to do with <strong>thermal conductivity</strong>, the rate at which heat is conducted from one object to another.</p>

<p>When you originally felt the blocks, you felt that the plastic block was warmer. But, what we observed is that the aluminium or metal block melted the ice cube faster. This is because the metal block is conducting the heat faster to the ice cube. The plastic block is a worse thermal conductor so less heat is being transferred to the ice cube and so it does not melt as fast.</p>

<p>Why then does the aluminium block feel colder than the plastic block?</p>

<p>This is because the aluminium conducts heat faster away from your hand than the plastic does. Therefore the aluminium block feels colder and the plastic block feels warmer. When you touch something, you do not actually feel the temperature. Rather you feel the rate at which heat is either conducted away from or towards you.</p>

<p>Let's think of another example of baking a cake. Imagine you have just finished baking a cake in the oven at 180 &#176;C.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec03-gd-0004.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A cake baking in the oven in a metal tin.</figcaption></figure><p>When you remove the cake from the oven, which is more likely to burn you more, the metal cake tin, or the cake?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The most likely answer is that the cake tin will give you a more serious burn.</p>

<p>For the next question, get learners to speculate about what they think about the <strong>temperature</strong> of the cake tin and the actual tin. Many people have the misconception that the tin is hotter than the cake as it <strong>feels</strong> hotter. They are actually at the same temperature as they have both been baking at 180 &#176;C.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Do you think the cake and the tin are at the same temperature when you remove them from the oven? Why?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Yes, the cake and the tin are both at the same temperature as they have been baking at 180 oC. Learners might be inclined to say that the tin is at a higher temperature than the cake as it feels hotter and the metal tin will give you a more serious burn than the actual cake. This is a misconception and you must discuss this. As with the example of the aluminium and plastic block, the cake tin and the cake are at the same temperature. But, the metal tin conducts heat faster towards your hand than the cake does. Therefore, the metal tin will feel hotter and is more likely to give you a serious burn than the cake does. When you touch something, you do not actually feel the temperature. Rather you feel the rate at which heat is either conducted away from or towards you.</p>

<p>What we have seen here is another example of thermal conductivity. The tin will conduct heat much faster to your hand than the cake, so the tin will burn you, but the cake will not. The tin and the cake are at the same temperature.</p>

<p>So what have we learnt? Metals conduct heat better than non-metals.</p>

<p/>

<p>Now that we have established that metals conduct heat energy better than non-metals, the learners will investigate which metals are the best conductors of heat. This investigation requires more heat than the previous one and so the learners should not test the conduction with their fingers.</p>

<p>Spend a few minutes before the learners begin by demonstrating the correct procedure for lighting a Bunsen burner. There are many different instructional videos on the internet, such as the one identified in the visit box in the margin. Here are a list of instructions for your reference:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Ensure that you are working on an appropriate surface, such as a fireproof mat, and that it is clean and uncluttered.</li>
<li>Make sure that the gas tube is in good condition and not perishing.</li>
<li>Connect the to the gas outlet securely and make sure it won't easily come off if moving the Bunsen burner around.</li>
<li>Make sure that the collar at the base of the Bunsen burner and the air hole are closed.</li>
<li>First light your match, holding it away from the Bunsen burner.</li>
<li>Turn on the gas with your other hand and bring the match to the Bunsen burner to light it.</li>
<li>Adjust the air hole by opening it so that the flame becomes hotter.</li>
<li>Adjust the intensity of the flame using the collar at the bottom.</li>
</ol><p>You can ask the learners to draw posters explaining how to light a Bunsen burner as an additional exercise if you feel they need the extra practice and reminders.</p>

<p>Remember that the tripods and metal rods that the learners use will get quite hot during this experiment. Make sure to allow the apparatus to cool before packing it away.</p>

<p>Write a hypothesis for this investigation.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Bunsen burner</li>
<li>Vaseline</li>
<li>copper, iron, brass and aluminium rod</li>
<li>stopwatch</li>
<li>drawing pins</li>

<li>cardboard or paper</li>
<li>matches</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The materials listed here are a suggestion. You can use alternative apparatus to still do this investigation. For example, a spirit burner could also be used to heat the rods. If you do not have a tripod stand, you can place the metal rods on another stand, such as a block of wood, with the ends sticking out one side to still reach over the Bunsen burner. Paper clips can also be used instead of drawing pins. The type of metals are not important as long as you have different metals of the same length.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Stick the flat end of a drawing pin to the end of each of the metal rods using the Vaseline. Try to use the same amount of Vaseline for each drawing pin.</li>
<li>Place the cardboard on the tripod.</li>
<li>Balance the metal rods on the cardboard so that one end of each is over the Bunsen burner.</li>
<li>Light the Bunsen burner.</li>
<li>Using a stopwatch, measure how long it takes for each of the pins to drop off.</li>
<li>Record your results in the table.</li>
<li>Draw a bar graph to illustrate your results.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>In this section we looked at how heat is conducted through metal rods and other objects. These were all <em>solid</em> objects. How is energy transferred through liquids or gases? Let's find out in the next section.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Convection</h2><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>convection</li>

<p>As an introduction to this section, you can simulate the "sitting in a bath" concept by filling a rectangular plastic tub or small water tank with cold water and then pouring hot water into one side. Invite the learners to feel the cold side of the tub and then feel it a few minutes later.</p>

<p>If you can get hold of a lava lamp, this can make a very exciting introduction to the lesson. You can turn the lights off and place the lava lamp on your desk for when learners come into the class. You can then explain that you are going to find out why the blobs rise and then fall back down in the lava lamp. If you do not have a lava lamp, you can also play this video: <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/DL3Ez9bxMTo"></iframe></p>

<p>Think of a pot of water on a stove. Only the bottom of the pot touches the stove plate, but all of the water inside the pot, even the water not touching the sides, becomes warmer. How does the energy transfer throughout the water in the pot? The transfer of energy is because of <strong>convection</strong>.</p>

<p>Let's do an activity that will help us to visualise how convection occurs.</p>

<p/><p/>

        
<p>The potassium permanganate will dissolve, but it will not form rising currents. It will diffuse evenly and densely at the bottom of the beaker. Over a long time it will spread out evenly throughout the water.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>Let's now explain what we observed in the last activity. Convection is the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another by the movement of gas or liquid particles. How does this happen?</p>

<p>As a gas or liquid is heated, the substance expands. This is because the particles in liquids and gases gain kinetic energy when they are heated and start to move faster. They therefore take up more space as the particles move further apart. This causes the heated liquid or gas to move upwards and the colder liquid or gas moves downwards. When the warm liquid or gas reaches the top it cools down again and therefore moves back down again.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We then say that the heated liquid or gas is less dense as the same particles are now taking up a larger space. We will learn more about density next year in Gr 8.</p>
</div>
<p>In the last activity, the water particles gained kinetic energy and moved apart from each other, therefore taking up more space. This water then moves upwards as it is less dense than the cold water, meaning it it lighter than the cold water. We were able to observe this as the potassium permanganate dissolved in the water and moved with the water particles, and then moved downwards again as the water cooled.</p>

<p>This movement of liquid or gas, is called a <strong>convection current</strong>, and energy is transferred from one area in the liquid or gas to another. Have a look at the diagram which shows a convection current.</p>

<p>Why do you think the smoke moves in this way?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The candle heats the air above it which creates a convection current which draws the cooler air on the other side of the cardboard towards the candle.

<p>In the last two activities, we have observed convection currents in a liquid and in a gas. Convection currents can only form in gases and liquids as these particles are free to move around. They are not held in fixed positions like in a solid. Solid particles are held together too tightly for them to move when heated. Solid particles will only vibrate faster when heated but will not move from their positions.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">

<p>We have now looked at how energy is transferred through different materials, whether they are solids (conduction) or liquids and gases (convection). But, what about if there are no particles to transfer the thermal energy? Is there still a way for energy to be transferred?</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-4">Radiation</h2><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>radiation</li>

</ul></div>
<p>Have you ever wondered how the Sun is able to warm us even though it is so far away? The energy is transferred from the Sun to everything on the Earth. The Sun does not need to be touching the Earth for the energy to be transferred. Also, there is space in between the Earth and the Sun. The energy from the Sun is able to warm us without the Sun ever touching us.</p>

<p>This transfer of energy is called <strong>radiation</strong>. It is different to conduction or convection as it does not require objects to be touching each other or the movement of particles.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Radiation comes from the Greek word<em>radius</em>, meaning a beam of light.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7ec03-gd-0012.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The Sun radiates heat in all directions. Energy is transferred through space to Earth</figcaption></figure><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>It takes light about 8 minutes to travel from the Sun to Earth.</p>
</div>
<p>We can also see how heat is transferred by radiation here on Earth, and not just between the Sun and the Earth. Let's demonstrate the difference between radiation and convection using a candle.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Radiation from a candle</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A suggestion is to do this as a demonstration and get learners to come up in small groups. You can then control how close they put their hands to the flame. Take note that heat radiates <strong>in all directions</strong> around the source of thermal energy (including the top of the candle). What makes us feel the heat more at the top is the effect of convection currents of the hot air moving up. They should first hold their hands above the flame to feel the heat from convection. Then they should hold their hands next to it to feel the heat transfer from radiation. Finally, you can also demonstrate conduction using a metal spoon and holding it in the flame.</p>

<p>We know now that heat from a candle will be transferred to the air around it. These will warm up. Where will this air move to?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The air particles will move upwards.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>What is this called?</p>

<p>Convection.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>So, when you hold your hand above the candle, what do you feel and why?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>When you hold your hand above the candle, the warm air particles transfer the energy to your hand causing your hand to warm up and you feel the increase in temperature.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">

<p>But, what about when you hold your hand on the side of the candle? Could you also feel warmth from the candle?</p>

<p/><p/>

        
<p>Yes</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>This is not convection as the air particles do not travel sideways when they warm up from the flame. So, how is energy transferred to your hand when you feel the warmth on the side of the candle?</p>

        
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">

<p>This photo shows all three forms of how heat is transferred. Explain which type of heat transfer is represented by each hand.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec03-gd-0013.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Energy is transferred in three ways.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The hand on the right holding the spoon represents conduction as the heat is transferred from the flame through the metal of the spoon. The hand above the candle represents convection as heat is transferred from the flame by moving air particles which warm up and rise. The hand above the candle will also experience heat from radiation as heat is radiated in all directions. The hand on the left next to the candle represents radiation as energy is transferred from the source through space to the hand.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>As we saw in the last activity, energy is transferred from the candle to your hand by convection and by radiation. Have you ever stood next to a huge fire? You will feel the radiating heat even though the air might be very cold. This is because the energy is transferred to you by radiation through the spaces between the particles in air.</p>

<p>What about if you touch a black wall or a white wall? Do you think there is a difference in how different surfaces <strong>absorb</strong> and <strong>reflect</strong> radiation? Let's find out by doing an investigation.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Which surfaces absorb the most radiation?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This investigation looks at the way different materials absorb radiation or reflect it. It is important that the surface area of each material is kept the same so that the results are reliable. This investigation will work best on a hot, sunny day. Try to find the sunniest place you can on the school grounds in order to conduct this investigation.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>We are going to investigate which surfaces absorb the most heat, using dark coloured paper, light coloured paper and shiny paper, such as aluminium foil. We will use the temperature inside an envelope made from each kind of paper as a measure of the amount of heat the paper absorbed. Why do you think we can do this?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Discuss this with your class as it is important that the understand why they are doing the investigation. When the paper envelope absorbs heat, the energy will then be transferred to the air inside the envelopes. This will then cause a rise in temperature which the thermometer will show. The more energy that is absorbed, the more that is transferred to the interior, and the higher the temperature. The paper that reflects the most energy will show the smallest increase in temperature.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>

<p>Write a conclusion for your investigation. Remember to refer back to the investigative question that we wanted to answer.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners should conclude that black surfaces absorb the most radiation and therefore show the biggest and fastest increase in temperature, whereas shiny surfaces absorb the least, as they reflect the most.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Radiation from the Sun is essential to life on Earth, but ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can also be very damaging our skin. Remember to wear suncream and a hat when outside and avoid being in direct sunlight between 11am and 2pm.</p>
</div>
<p>The investigation showed that the dark envelope showed the biggest increase in temperature. The lighter coloured envelope showed a smaller increase in temperature. The envelope made out of a shiny material showed the smallest increase in temperature.</p>

<p>So what have we learnt? Dark colours seem to absorb more of the Sun's radiation than light or reflective colours. So, if you want to stay warm on a cold day, dark clothing will absorb more of the available warmth from the Sun's radiation than light colours.</p>

<p>The average summer temperature in Hotazel, a town in the Northern Cape is about 34 &#176;C. If you lived in Hotazel and needed to buy a new car, would you buy a light or dark-coloured car? Explain why.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The best colour to buy would be a white car because, as seen in the investigation, light colours absorb less heat than dark colours. So a light-coloured car will ideally remain the coolest on the inside.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>You have the option of getting the car sprayed to make the surface more shiny. Do you think this will help keep the car cool in hot, summer months? Explain why.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Yes, it will help, as shiny surfaces are more reflective and so more radiant heat is reflected rather than absorbed, keeping the inside of the car cooler.</p>

<p>Your parents have a metal hot water geyser and they are complaining about the amount of energy needed to keep the water hot. What can you recommend your parents could do to prevent energy loss from the geyser? Explain your answer. [4 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Metals are good conductors of heat and so the heat from the water is transferred out of the geyser. A (shiny foil) insulating blanket could be used to wrap around the geyser. The air between the blanket and the geyser is a poor conductor of heat so the heat loss will be slower.</p>

<p>Explain why the heating element for a kettle is at the bottom and not at the top. [3 marks]</p>

<p/><p/>

        
<p>The heating element is at the bottom because as the element transfers energy to the water, the water expands and moves upwards and the colder water (slower moving particles) will sink to the bottom, forming a convection current This cycle will ensure that all the water is heated as quickly as possible. If the element was at the top, the water at the bottom would take much longer to boil.</p>

        
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

        
<p>Learners must mention the term convection current.</p>

<p>Explain why you think the water boils throughout the kettle pot and not just at the bottom? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The water at the bottom of the pot gets hot and then moves to the top of the pot because of convection. This allows the cold water to sink to the bottom and heat up. This constant circulation allows all of the water to heat up and boil.</p>

<p>Explain why you think take-away coffee is sold in styrofoam cups rather than ceramic cups. [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Normal ceramic cups are good conductors of heat and so the energy from the coffee is transferred quickly through the cup to the surroundings. The styrofoam is a poor conductor of heat and so it does not allow the energy from the coffee to move quickly to the surrounding air, so the coffee stays warmer for longer.</p>

<p>Explain why you think two thin blankets can sometimes be warmer than one thick blanket. [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Air is trapped between the two blankets. The air is a very poor conductor of heat and so it becomes an extra insulating layer which slows down the loss of energy from your body. One blanket cannot trap as much air and so isn't as warm as two blankets.</p>

<p>Explain why birds fluff up their feathers to stay warm, especially in winter. [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Birds fluff up their feathers so that more air gets trapped between the feathers. The air is a poor conductor of heat and so the energy from the birds body is not transferred to the surroundings.</p>

<p>Why should you place an air conditioner at the top of a room, near the ceiling, rather than at the bottom near the floor? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>This is because cold air will move downwards, therefore cooling the room, and the hot air will rise and can therefore be removed by the air conditioner at the top of the room, near the ceiling.</p>

<p>Imagine you want to build a small enclosure for some chickens on your property. You have an outside area for them that is made from barbed wire, and you have made a small inside, covered enclosure for them out of bricks and cement which you would like to paint. You know that it can get quite cold in winter in your area so you want the house to be as warm as possible for the chickens. What colour paint are you going to choose to paint the outside of chicken house? Will it be a dark-coloured paint, such as brown or black, or a light-coloured paint, such as white or yellow? Explain your choice. [4 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The best choice to keep the house as warm as possible on the inside is a dark-coloured paint. This is because the dark colours absorb more radiant heat from the Sun during the day, than the light colours, which reflect heat. The dark paint will absorb the heat and it will be transferred to the air inside of the house, making it warmer, especially during winter.</p>
