<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>This chapter follows on from the last chapter where we mentioned that heat can be 'lost' as energy is transferred to the surroundings. This chapter now explains that within a system, there is useful energy which is transferred to the desired object or place, but no process is 100% efficient. Energy can be transferred to the surroundings rather than to the object or part of the system that you want it to transfer to. This is considered a waste of energy and systems are designed to try minimize this waste so that they are more efficient. There is always some loss of energy (wasted energy) and so there are always by-products to energy production. Some of the by-products are harmful to the environment.</p>

<p>Important to note is that CAPS makes the following statement:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><em>'The output energy in a system is always less than the input energy, because some of the energy escapes to the environment.'</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>This is <strong>not correct</strong> as the output energy is always equal to the input energy as energy is conserved within systems. The statement should rather state:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><em>'The  output energy in a system is always less than the input energy, because some of the energy escapes to the environment.'</em></p>
</li>
</ul><p>The wasted energy is still part of the output energy from the system, it is just not useful.</p>

<p>The learners will not have seen <strong>Sankey diagrams</strong> before. You should explain the usefulness of representing processes using pictures. Illustrations make a quick, visual impact on the viewer which makes it easier to understand a process. A Sankey diagram is a visual representation of an energy process showing the input energy and the output energy. Sankey diagrams should be drawn neatly and as close to scale as possible. Take the time to draw several examples on the board so that the learners see that all energy processes have more than one output energy type.</p>

</div>
<p>This term we have been looking at energy transfers within systems. Systems have an input energy and an output energy. Systems such as appliances, tools, vehicles and machines provide us with a useful output. Let's look at some examples to identify what these outputs are in some systems.</p>

<p>What was the input for each of these systems?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Electricity/electrical energy.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Whenever we use an appliance or a machine we are transferring energy from one object to another. Not all the energy is transferred where we want it, a lot of it is transferred to the surroundings where it does not help us achieve our aims. The energy which is transferred to the surroundings is "<strong>wasted</strong>".</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>Watch how this chocolate rabbit melts beneath an energy-inefficient light bulb.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/16s7AtK">bit.ly/16s7AtK</a></p>
</div>
<p>We can use a <strong>Sankey diagram</strong> to show how the energy is transferred in a system. This gives us a picture of what is happening and shows the input energy and how the output energy is made up of useful energy (arrow at the top) and wasted energy (arrow going to the bottom). Have a look at the following general example.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp28402896"><img src="images/gr7ec05-gd-0007.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Sankey diagrams are named after the Irish Captain Matthew Sankey, who first used this type of diagram in 1898 in a publication on the energy efficiency of a steam engine.</p>
</div>
<p>The width of the arrows tell us something in these diagrams. The input energy is the width of the original arrow. The width of both the output energy arrows (useful and wasted) add up to the width of the input arrow. Why do you think this is so? Think back to what you learned about energy within systems in Chapter 2.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is because energy is neither created nor destroyed, but conserved within a system. So the input must equal the output energy in a system.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Sankey diagrams are drawn to scale so that the width of the arrows gives us a visual idea of how much energy is useful and how much is wasted. In the diagram above, you can see that only a small part of the input energy was useful and a large amount of the input was wasted by being transferred to the surroundings. An efficient system is one where the useful output energy is only slightly smaller than the input energy. An inefficient system has a lot of wasted energy. Do you think this is an efficient energy system? Why?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>No, it is not efficient as a lot of the energy is wasted.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>This brings us to our next point of how efficient an energy system is. If the wasted energy is much larger than the useful energy output, then the system is not energy efficient. The above Sankey diagram actually shows the energy transfers for a light bulb. You identified the useful energy output as light in the last activity. What do you think the wasted energy output is? Where does it go?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is lost as heat, as energy is transferred to the surrounding air.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Do you see that an incandescent light bulb is actually not a very efficient system? This is because a lot of the energy is lost as heat as energy is transferred to the surroundings. Is there something more efficient? Look at the photo of a fluorescent light bulb.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec05-gd-0008.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A fluorescent light bulb.</figcaption></figure><p>A fluorescent light bulb is much more efficient than incandescent light bulbs which use a heated wire to produce light. Most of the energy is lost as it is transferred to the surrounding air from the metal filament. In a fluorescent light bulb, less energy is lost to the surroundings and more energy is transferred to useful light energy. Use this information to draw a Sankey diagram for a fluorescent light bulb in the space below.</p>

<p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learner's diagram should look as follows:</p>
<figure id="gd-idp19966480"><img src="images/gr7ec05-gd-0009.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>
</div>
<p>Let's look at another example. Look at the lady in the photo using an electric drill. The electrical energy from the drill is transferred to the drill bit as kinetic energy. The drill bit turns and drills into the metal. But the drill also makes a lot of noise. Energy is used to make sound and the drill bits get hot, so some of the energy is converted into thermal energy. This means that some of the electrical energy has been transferred to the surroundings as sound and thermal energy. This is energy that has been "wasted" because the sound and thermal energy are not useful to us.</p>

<p>Now that we have identified the energy transfers in each system and the input and output energy, let's practice drawing some more Sankey diagrams.</p>

</div><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Drawing Sankey diagrams</h1>
<p>Let's look at the example of a filament light bulb to draw a Sankey diagram. A filament light bulb only uses about 10101010101010101010% of the input energy to generate light, the rest is "wasted" because it warms up the surrounding air without producing any light. This means that our Sankey diagram must split into two parts: one for the light and one for the thermal energy which is transferred to the surroundings (heat). The thermal energy arrow must be 90% of the width of the input arrow and the light arrow must be 10% of the width of the input arrow.</p>

<p>Most of our everyday activities require some form of electrical energy. Electricity is produced by burning fuels and transforming the chemical potential energy into kinetic energy to generate electricity. Fossil fuels, such as coal, store huge amounts of energy but we can only harness a small percentage of that energy. A lot of the energy is transferred to the surroundings in the form of heat, sound and light.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Researching energy transfers</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is a research activity. If your learners have access to the internet and/or a library then allow them to spend some time researching the energy transfers in a power plant and a car engine. If your learners do not have access to the internet then it would be a good idea to print out some information from various websites that can be handed out to the class. You could let the printed information circulate through the class so that you do not need as many copies. This will save on paper and printing costs.</p>

<p>In this activity, they will first see how the wasted energy can be in more than one form and how to represent this in a Sankey diagram for a car engine. Learners will then research a power plant. You can get the learners to work in groups to find the information but make sure that each learner is able to write their own paragraph. This will give you a sense of whether or not the learner has understood what they have researched.</p>

<p>Here is a resource for reference: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bbc.in/15vnPFJ">bbc.in/15vnPFJ</a></p>

<p>In our previous Sankey diagrams, we just had one arrow for wasted energy output, but it can split into more than one arrow to represent the different ways in which energy is wasted. There could also be more than one arrow for the useful energy, for example in the TV diagram above, light and sound are both useful and could be represented by two arrows.</p>
</div>
<p>In the last activity we looked at the energy transfers in a car engine. However, we only used one arrow to represent the wasted energy. We can show a difference between the ways in which energy is wasted in a Sankey diagram. Use the following information to label the Sankey diagram:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The input energy in a car engine is supplied by the combustion of petrol.</li>
<li>
<p>Only 30% of the energy is transferred to useful output energy as movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About 70% of the energy is transferred to the surroundings in the form of thermal energy and sound. Some of the energy is lost in cooling down the engine.</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>40% is lost as thermal to the surroundings.</li>

<p>Use the internet or other resources to find the different ways in which energy is transferred to the surroundings as wasted energy during the production of electricity in a power plant.</p>

<p>What is meant by "wasted" energy? [2 marks]</p>

<p/><p/>

        
<p>In an energy system, some of the energy is transferred to the surroundings in ways which we did not intend or are not useful. This amount of energy serves no useful purpose and so it is "wasted".</p>

<p>In the chapter, learners used percentages to draw their Sankey diagrams. The following is an extension and starts off with a simple example which they have already seen in the chapter, namely a light bulb, but the energy transfers were represented as percentages. In the first example here, we now start off with 100 J instead of 100%. The Sankey diagram will be straightforward to draw. However, in the subsequent examples, the input energy is more than 100 J. Learners do not need to calculate the percentages, but the thickness of the arrows should be representative of the amount transferred.</p>

<p>a. The potential energy from the batteries in the torch is transferred to the filament of the bulb. The energy is transferred to the surroundings as thermal energy and light. Most of the energy is transferred as thermal energy which is not useful and only some of the energy is transferred as light.</p>

        
<p>b. The energy from the TV is transferred to the surroundings as thermal energy, sound and light. The light and sound are useful because they are the images and sounds we want to hear. The heat is wasted energy.</p>

        
<p>c. The energy from the hair dryer is used to heat the air and dry our hair. Two thirds of the energy is useful thermal energy but one third is transferred as sound, which is not useful to us.</p>

<p>What is the difference between a filament light bulb and an energy saving light bulb? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>A filament light bulb uses a metal filament and an energy saving light bulb uses a fluorescent gas to provide light.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>Why is an energy saving light bulb better at saving energy than a filament light bulb? [3 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>A lot of the energy used to make a filament bulb glow is used to heat the metal to make the metal glow. This means that a lot of the energy is wasted as thermal energy when we actually want light. Energy saving bulbs don't have to heat the gas before it will glow and so it wastes less energy.</p>

<p>In the last chapter we looked at insulating materials and how they help reduce energy transfer. Use this knowledge, and what you have learned in this chapter about input energy, useful output energy and wasted energy, to explain why an electric geyser should have an insulating layer on the outside. [4 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>An electric geyser transfers electricity to thermal energy in the water particles as the water is warmed up. The useful output is the thermal energy to warm the water. However, some of this thermal energy can escape from geyser to the surroundings. This is therefore wasted. In order to make the geyser system more efficient so that the useful energy output is greater and the thermal energy loss is minimized, the geyser should have an insulating covering, to reduce energy transfer to the surroundings by conduction.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>In the electric geyser, the heating element is placed near the bottom of the geyser. Why is this? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The heating element is placed at the bottom as this is more efficient because as the water warms up due to the transfer of energy, the heated water expands and moves upwards, and the cold water moves down in a convection current, thereby warming all the water.</p>
