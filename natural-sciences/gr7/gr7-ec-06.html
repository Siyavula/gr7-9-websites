<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>This chapter revises some of the concepts covered in Gr. 6 Energy and Change on the supply of electricity. The learners should already have a basic knowledge of the national grid and this chapter will expand on those ideas, and discuss how the national grid is a system to supply electricity. This chapter also introduces the concept of a dynamo and the role that Eskom plays in producing electricity. Learners will be given an opportunity to research different careers in the field of energy production.</p>

<p>If you only teach Natural Sciences, it is a good idea to check with the Technology teachers to see how these two curriculums complement each other, especially with regard to electricity. Some of the concepts which might be introduced for the first time in Natural Sciences, have already been covered in the Technology curriculum. Knowing what learners have already covered and been introduced to will help make your classes more efficient and more stimulating for learners.</p>

<p>Do you remember learning about the mains electricity supply in Gr. 6 Energy and Change? We learned that the electricity that is used to power our homes, schools, shops and other buildings is generated in power stations and delivered to us in the <strong>national electricity grid</strong>. In this chapter we are going to be looking in more detail at how electricity is generated and delivered to the consumers.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="visit">

<p>The visit box refers to an excellent video on the national grid and summarises where energy comes from, how it is harnessed, and how it is distributed. It links back to work covered in Gr. 5 and Gr. 6. It does, however, only refer to the national grid of the UK and USA. You could use this as an opportunity to discuss the South African national grid in contrast to international electricity grids and supply systems. <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1hniv7m">bit.ly/1hniv7m</a></p>

<p>The national electricity grid is actually a big electrical circuit. Look at the following diagram of a simple electric circuit that you might have made in class and the diagram of the national grid. We can draw similarities between this circuit and the national electricity grid to understand it.</p>

<p>We can divide the national electricity grid up into 4 main stages. These are:</p>

          
<p><strong>A: Generation</strong> (this is where electricity is generated)</p>

          
<p><strong>B: Transmission</strong> (the electricity enters the power lines of the national grids and is transmitted)</p>

          
<p><strong>C: Distribution</strong> (the electricity is distributed at substations to various towns and areas)</p>

          
<p><strong>D: Consumers</strong> (this is where the electricity is transferred to useful energy outputs)</p>

          
        
<p>Use this information to write the letters A, B, C and D on the diagram of the national electricity grid to label these stages.</p>

<p>Let's now take a closer look at the first stage in the national electricity grid, namely how electricity is generated.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">How electricity is generated and supplied</h3><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>turbine</li>

<p>Do you remember that in Chapter 2 we looked at another renewable way that electricity is generated using a hydropower plant. The water in the dam was used to turn the <strong>turbine</strong> to generate electricity. What energy did the water have when it was at the top in the dam?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Potential energy.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What was this energy transferred to as the water fell and turned the turbine?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is transferred to kinetic energy.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>In South Africa most of the power stations use coal for fuel. We are therefore going to learn more about how coal-powered power stations work. The coal is mined out of the earth. The coal is transported to the power station in large trucks or trains.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We will learn about how coal is formed next term in Planet Earth and Beyond.</p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at what happens inside a power station. Have a look at the following diagram.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp17266896"><img src="images/gr7ec06-gd-0005.png" width="300"/></figure><ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p>The large chunks of coal are first crushed into a fine powder. This is called <strong>pulverisation</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coal is then transported to a <strong>furnace</strong> where it is burnt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thermal energy from the burning coal is used to boil water and generate <strong>steam</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The steam pushes the blades of the <strong>turbine</strong> and so the turbine spins.</p>

<p>In a coal-powered power station, the potential energy stored in the coal is used to boil water to produce steam.</p>

<p>The thermal energy in the steam is transferred to a turbine. This allows the turbine to turn which means that the turbine now has kinetic energy. Can you see how energy is transferred from a thermal system to a mechanical system?</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec06-gd-0007.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A steam turbine with the outer case removed.</figcaption></figure><p>How does the steam make the turbine turn? Let's make a simple turbine (pinwheel) and see how it works.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Turning a pinwheel</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If you do not have enough time in class to have each learner make their own pinwheel then either make a few before class that the learners can use or just make one to use as a demonstration. You may also be able to purchase small pinwheels to save class time.</p>

<p>Some kettles may produce a weaker stream of steam and so it would be a good idea to test the kettle with a paper pinwheel before doing it with the class. You can also watch the video provided in the Visit box.</p>

<p>If the pin wheel which is made using the A5 paper is too large to turn in the steam from a kettle, then redo the activity using a smaller piece of paper. Starting with a smaller piece of paper will result in a smaller pinwheel. Take note that the commercial pinwheels made from plastic often curl and melt in the steam.</p>

<p>Why did the pinwheel turn? Explain the energy transfers which are taking place.</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>The element in the kettle transfers energy to the water in the kettle. The water then gets to boiling point and changes phase to water vapour. The steam rises because of convection. The moving particles push against the blades of the pinwheel and cause the pinwheel to turn. The steam has a lot of kinetic energy which is transferred to the blades of the pinwheel causing it to turn. There is a transfer of energy between a thermal system and a mechanical system.</p>

          
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>The turning turbine is attached to the axle of a generator. The turning turbine turns the generator. So the turbine transfers its kinetic energy to the generator.</p>

<p>A generator consists of a very large <strong>solenoid</strong> with a large rotating magnet. The solenoid is made up of thousands of coils of conducting wire. When the magnet is turned inside the coil, the generator produces electricity. The electricity is then sent to our homes through the national grid power lines. We use the energy in our homes to make our appliances work.</p>

<p/>

<p>Take note that an electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, normally using electromagnetic induction. A dynamo was actually the precursor to the modern day electric generators. now, it can be considered as a type of generator that produces <strong>direct</strong> current, with the use of commutators. At this level though in Gr. 7, we are not explaining the difference between direct and alternating current. Generators are used all over the world now, and dynamos are considered to be an instrument of the past, however, they are still used in some instances where a low powered DC current is required, such as a bicycle light, as discussed here. Make sure that learners do not use the words generator and dynamo interchangeably as a dynamo is a type of generator, but it is incorrect to call a generator a dynamo.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Eskom produces electricity by using large generators but we can produce electricity on a smaller scale using a <strong>dynamo</strong>. A dynamo is a type of generator and they are considered to be the device that came before and led to the development of the modern day electrical generators that are used now all over the world. However, dynamos are still used in some places where a low current is needed.</p>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>A dynamo is a type of generator, but a generator is not necessarily a dynamo.</p>
</div>
<p>A bicycle light is powered by a small dynamo. A bicycle dynamo has a small magnet which is turned inside a metal coil. The magnet is turned by the motion of the bicycle wheel.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec06-gd-0019.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A dynamo on the wheel of a bicycle.</figcaption></figure><p>Do you see the cog which turns at the top as the wheel goes around? This turns the magnet enclosed in the dynamo. Explain the transfer of energy in this system.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The movement (kinetic energy) of the wheel is transferred to electrical energy.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What is the advantage of having a dynamo on the bicycle, rather than a battery for example?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The dynamo is used to generate electricity to power a light for the bicycle. This is useful as a battery will only last for a certain amount of time and run out. But, a dynamo will work whenever you are cycling as it just needs the movement of the wheel.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Dynamos are also used in mining helmets and wind-up torches and radios. If a miner's light on his helmet goes out, he can just wind up the dynamo again to generate electricity for the light. This is very useful when miners are deep underground and they cannot afford to have no light. A battery-powered light has the risk of running out and there is no way to recharge it when underground.</p>

<p>Electricity is very expensive to produce and, in South Africa, we rely heavily on non-renewable sources of energy such as coal. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing damage to our environment. We therefore need to conserve electricity.</p></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-6">Conserving electricity in the home</h2><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>conserve</li>
</ul></div>
<p>In South Africa, electricity is produced by Eskom and sent to our homes through the wires of the national grid. Eskom charges us for the electricity we use. In order to save money and to preserve our environment we need to make sure that we use as little electricity as possible.</p>

<p>There are many ways to cut down on the amount of electricity we use in our homes. Simple things such as switching off lights when you leave a room or using extra blankets to keep warm rather than a heater. Air conditioners also use a lot of electricity so using them only when really necessary will also help to save electricity.</p>

<p>There are several common household appliances which use a lot of electricity. The element of an electric stove and ovens use a lot of electricity in order to stay hot enough to cook food. Electricity can be saved by making sure that the oven is switched off as soon as the food has been cooked.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ec06-gd-0020.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An electric oven.</figcaption></figure><p>An electric stove usually has several different sizes of heating elements. In the photo there are two large plates and two smaller ones. It is important to use small pots on small elements and large pots on larger elements. Why do you think this is?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The part of the heating element which is not covered by the pot is transferring thermal energy to the air surrounding the element rather than to the pot and so a lot more energy is "wasted".</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Geyser blankets and solar geysers</h1>
<p>Any appliance that produces heat requires a lot of electricity. A <strong>geyser</strong> is an appliance which uses a lot of electricity. A geyser is a cylindrical tank which is used to warm and store hot water for people to use in their homes. It takes a lot of energy to warm the water and so a lot of electricity is needed. A lot of the energy transferred to the water is wasted because the air around the geyser gets warmed up as energy leaves the water and is transferred to the air. The geyser has to keep warming the water to keep the temperature constant.</p>

<p>One way to help reduce the energy loss to the surrounding air is to use a geyser blanket. Geyser blankets are usually between 50 mm and 150 mm thick and are often made from fibreglass and other insulating materials. They are covered with a reflective aluminium layer.</p>

<p>Solar geysers do not use electricity from the national grid for their energy needs. We have already learned about how they work.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>Use your knowledge of insulating materials to explain how a geyser blanket could help reduce energy loss from the water to the surroundings, and therefore conserve electricity.</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The thick fibre layer helps to reduce the energy loss by slowing down the conduction of heat from the water to the air. The shiny aluminium layer is not a good emitter of radiation and so less energy is lost through radiation.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>How does installing a solar geyser contribute to relieving demand placed on the national grid?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The solar panels generate the required electricity and so it isn't generated by Eskom. It is the electricity supplied by Eskom that needs to be conserved. This also reduces the demand on non-renewable energy sources which have a negative impact on the environment.</p>

<p/>

<p>Our country relies heavily on fossil fuels for our energy supply. Eskom power stations use coal, which is a non-renewable energy source. How can saving electricity in our homes help to reduce our negative impact on the environment?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>This question links back to what learners covered in Chapter 1 on sources of energy. Burning fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases which contribute to the greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. This contributes to global warming. If we use electricity in our homes wisely and save electricity, we reduce the load on the coal-powered stations, and therefore help to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
          
<p/>

<p>What renewable energy alternatives could your family use in your house to reduce your use of electricity supplied by coal-powered stations through the national electricity grid?</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Learners can suggest installing solar panels on the roofs of their house to rather make use of solar power as it is a renewable energy source. Electric geysers also use a huge amount of electricity to warm water, therefore installing a solar water heater (as discussed in Chapter 4), the family will reduce their load on the national supply system by rather using alternative energy sources.</p>

<p>This is an optional activity aimed at creating awareness amongst learners about our country's reliance on fossil fuels and the negative environmental impact. This can also be done as a homework task.</p>

<p>Learners will need to write a letter to their local newspaper. Encourage learners to do some extra research about the area in which you live. For example, looking at the direct impacts of a coal station on your area, such as the possible effects of acid rain. Learners should research the renewable energy power stations that might already be in the area which could rather be expanded.</p>

<p>This is a creative writing piece but also a research task. Learners must reference any sources that they use. Learners must include in their letter, their motivation for why renewable energy sources should rather be explored. The scientific accuracy of their letters must also be assessed.</p>

<p>The purpose of this activity is to engage learners in constructive, problem-solving thinking.</p>

Your local community is upset about this due to the effects of the pollution on the environment. Your community also feels that greater measures are needed to change the way we rely so heavily on non-renewable sources. We should rather be looking at alternative ways of generating electricity. You decide to do some research about the best possible solution for a power station, other than one which uses fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Learners need to justify their answers. You should assess their reasoning and explanations of answers. Some points for answers in this question: Non-renewable energy sources are not sustainable in the long term as there is only a limited supply, they are not renewable. South Africa needs to think ahead to plan for when the supply of non-renewable energy sources runs out, by looking at alternative renewable solutions. The use of non-renewable energy sources has a negative impact on the environment due to the emission of greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming and acid rain which ruins crops and buildings.</p>

<p>Why does a miner need a dynamo instead of a battery for his helmet light? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Batteries run out quite quickly. Miners are underground for long periods of time and a dynamo does not run out of energy. The miner can just wind up the dynamo by hand again as soon as the electric light in the helmet begins to fade.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The bar graph should have a heading [1 mark] which indicates what the bar graph represents. An example heading could be "Amount of energy used by common household appliances in one hour.". The type of appliance should be listed on the horizontal x-axis [1 mark]. The number of kilojoules should be plotted on the vertical y-axis [1 mark]. The height of each bar should be correct according to the scale of the vertical axis [1 mark]. There should be gaps between the bars of the graph [1 mark].</p>
