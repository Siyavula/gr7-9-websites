<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>3.5 weeks</p>

<p>After looking at the biosphere and where life exists on Earth, we will now look at the biodiversity of life on Earth. This chapter starts off with looking at the classification system and how scientists have classified all living organisms. This hierarchical classification system provides an overview and will be dealt with again in Gr. 10 if learners take Life Sciences. After looking at the five kingdoms, we will then look at the biodiversity of plants and animals. In CAPS, learners would have looked at the variety in plants and animals before in Gr. 5 and heard the term biodiversity. This is built upon and extended as we look at the different classifications of plants and animals. The other three kingdoms, namely Protista, Fungi and Bacteria are not dealt with in detail, but in Gr. 9, learners will again look at some examples when they do microorganisms in more detail.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>If possible, display a selection of nature magazines, books and reading materials in the class during the time that you go through this chapter. You can collect photos or pictures from magazines of many different plants and animals, fungi and bacteria. A suggestion is to cover them in plastic, in order to reuse them in subsequent years.</p>

<p>Over millions of years each species living today has changed and adapted to live in a specific type of environment in order to ensure the survival of that species. <strong>Biodiversity</strong>is a term used to describe the great variety of living organisms on Earth and their varied habitats.</p>

<p/>

<p>There are just so many types of organisms. How can we make sense of all the organisms on Earth? We need some way to group them. This is called classifying. Let's find out how we do this!</p>

<p>Grouping has been a common activity in humans for thousands of years as we make sense of the world around us.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Group some everyday objects</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>In this activity learners will get an opportunity to group a selection of everyday objects according to observable features. This lays the foundation for the classification and grouping work that is covered in this section. Teachers should collect enough shoeboxes or recycled ice-cream tubs (or if this is not possible shopping bags should also work) for each of the groups in the class. As homework the previous day each learner needs to bring five items from home. These items should be small enough to go into the shoebox. They should choose items that they use in their everyday lives. Please ensure that no valuables are brought!</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Possible answers might include: Some animals fit into more than one group (penguin, crocodile, etc.) because it looks more at what the animals do rather than what they are or similarities and differences between their forms.</p>

<p/>

<p>As more and more animals, plants and microorganisms were discovered, scientists started questioning Aristotle's classification system. It was not working as well as everyone had believed it would. Why do you think it is important to evaluate <em>how</em> we classify things?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Discuss this as a class. Refer to this process as being a constant refining of the way that classification is done and that it is not a 'given' or a static method. It needs to evolve as our knowledge and understanding of the world and the organisms in it develops and must take these new discoveries into account.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7ll02-gd-0011.jpg" width="250"/><figcaption class="caption">Carl Linnaeus</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>In the 1700s Carl Linnaeus developed the classification system that classified organisms according to their similarities,  functions and relationships with other organisms.</p>

<p/>

<p>Today with the use of modern microscopes and genetics we can classify living organisms very accurately. In this way we are able to classify living organisms according to their shared characteristics.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Scientists estimate that there are up to 30 million species of organisms on Earth! If they use systems to classify these organisms they can see patterns in nature and can see how organisms relate to each other.</p>
</div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">Our classification system</h3>
<p>All living organisms can be divided into five <strong>kingdoms</strong>:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p><strong>Animals</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plants</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fungi</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protists</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bacteria</strong></p>
</li>
</ol><p/>
<figure id="gd-idp4154720"><img src="images/gr7ll02-gd-0012.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>What are humans? Which kingdom do we belong to? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Since we know that we are not a fungi or plant, or a protista or bacteria (quite a bit bigger!) we belong to the animal kingdom.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The kingdom Bacteria is often also referred to as <strong>Monera</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Think back to the example of how we classify learners at school. First, school is divided into pre-primary school, primary school and high school. If we compare school to the way we classify organisms, we can say that the school system has three kingdoms. But, we need to divide learners up further. So primary school is divided into seven grades (Gr. 1-7) and  high school is divided into five grades (Gr. 8-12). The classification system for organisms also needs to divide organisms up further as each kingdom contains thousands of different types of organisms.</p>

<p/>

<p>Each kingdom is divided into smaller groups or divisions called <strong>phyla</strong>. Organisms with similar traits (characteristics) will occupy a similar phylum. In each phylum, smaller divisions called <strong>classes</strong> are found and each class is further divided into <strong>orders</strong>, <strong>families</strong>, <strong>gen era</strong>and then<strong>species</strong>.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Be careful to use these words correctly: one<em> phylum</em>, many<em> phyla</em>. Similarly, one<em> genus</em>, many <em>genera.</em></p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Think of your school again. Your primary school contains many learners. When you divide your entire school into grades, there are fewer learners in each grade. Your grade might be divided into different classes, and each class has fewer learners in it. When we classify organisms, the same thing happens. A kingdom is a very big group, whereas a species is a much smaller group.</p>

<p/>

<p>Study this diagram to help you remember the order:</p>

<p/>

<p>We need to be able to distinguish between organisms too. So how do we name organisms?</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Binomial comes from the Latin<em>bi</em>- two and <em>nomius</em>- names. Nomenclature comes from Latin words <em>nomen</em> - name and <em>calare-</em> to call. Binomial nomenclature therefore means calling things by two names.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Carl Linnaeus designed a special naming system called the <strong>binomial nomenclature</strong> to name all organisms. All organisms are therefore given <strong>two</strong> (bi- means two) words in their name.</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The first part of the name refers to the genus that the organism belongs to. This is always written with a capital letter.</li>
<li>The second part of the name refers to the species within the genus</li>
<li>
<p>If you are typing you will put both these names in <em>italics</em> but if you are doing a handwritten piece you underline it. This shows that you are identifying the organism by its scientific name.</p>
</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>For example, the scientific name for the African elephant is <em>Loxodonta africana</em>. Humans belong to the genus <em>Homo</em> and to the species <em>sapiens</em> so we are <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p>

<p>Fungi play a very important role in our biosphere since they break down dead organic material and return nutrients to the soil for plants to use. Some fungi cause diseases while others, such as penicillin (an antibiotic) are very useful to us. Yeast is used in many of our products, such as making bread rise and fermenting wine and beer.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Protists and Bacteria</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners will only be able to fully understand the differences between Protists and Bacteria once they have done cells in Gr. 9. Essentially, Protists are eukaryotic (usually unicellular, but not always) as they have cells with a membrane bound nucleus, whereas Bacteria are prokaryotic as their DNA material is not membrane bound. Bacteria are always unicellular. Protists require a liquid medium, whereas Bacteria occur almost everywhere.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We will look at Protists and Bacteria in more detail later on in Gr. 9. For now, lets look at some of the basic features of these kingdoms.</p>

<p/>

<p>Organisms in these two kingdoms are microscopic which means you cannot see them with your naked eye. However we can see them if we look at them under a microscope.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>These images are included to give learners some idea about these two kingdoms, otherwise they will have no reference point until they get to Gr. 8 and do microorganisms again. These images are also interesting and show what is possible with the microscopy techniques available today. They include a range of techniques from scanning electron microscopy, confocal, fluorescent and light microscopy. The differentiation of a membrane bound nucleus in Protists and not in Bacteria is too advanced for learners at this stage if they have not yet done cells. For now, encourage learners to look at the photos, perhaps ask them to explain what they see, and let them get excited about the unseen world! Learners do not need to know how to recognise or name any of these microorganisms.</p>

<p>Now we will look at the amazing diversity of animals and plants on Earth, and especially in South Africa.</p></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-6">Diversity of animals</h2><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>diversity</li>

<li>vertebrate</li>
</ul></div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Provide learners with old magazines and ask them to cut out any and all animals that they see. (If you teach this lesson a few years running it is worth the effort and money to cut their animals out carefully and have these laminated then they can be used over and over again!) When they have collected a large quantity of animals ask them to group the animals into only two groups. Encourage them to manipulate the animals and transfer them from one group to another, and encourage positive debate about their groupings and why they chose those specific groupings. Then end result should be that there are two main groups of animals, and scientifically speaking these would hopefully be vertebrates and invertebrates, or alternatively those with feathers and those without; those with mammary glands and those without, those with wings and those without, etc. As learners work with the pictures make sure to model words like observe, compare, contrast, evaluate, etc.</p>

<p/>

<p>Some learners might ask "WHY" we classify and they should be praised for doing this. If this occurs point out to them that classification helps us to sort out ancestor / descendent relationships and we are therefore able to track the evolutionary history of all living organisms.Thus the presence or absence of one specific characteristic might show that an organism is related to others in in a specific genus, family or order and can also guide an investigation into the evolutionary history of these organisms. Many learners might for instance be unaware that lions, rhino and elephants are indigenous to Africa but are also found naturally in other parts of the world, like India, and through classification we are able to see how the Black Buck and the Koedoe, or the One-horned Rhinoceros of Asia and the South African black rhino are related.</p>
</div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-7">Classifying animals</h3>
<p>All the animals in the world form part of the animal kingdom.There are two distinct divisions or groups of animals within the animal kingdom: the <strong>vertebrates</strong> and the <strong>invertebrates</strong>. Can you remember what is used to classify an animal as a vertebrate or invertebrate? Look at these x-rays of animals for a clue.  </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The presence or absence of a backbone is used to classify animals as vertebrates or invertebrates. The dolphin, dog and goose are vertebrates and the grasshopper and crab are invertebrates.</p>
</div><figure id="gd-idp7268864"><img src="images/gr7ll02-gd-0028.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Almost 98% of all the animals that have been discovered on Earth are invertebrates!</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Animals that have a backbone with a hollow tube inside to hold the nerves are vertebrates. As we can see in the x-ray images of the dolphin, dog and goose, we can see the skeletons of these vertebrates. They are made of bone. We say that vertebrates have an endoskeleton.</p>

<p/>

<p>What about the grasshopper and the crab? Why can we not see their bones? This is because invertebratesdo not have a skeleton made of bones. The grasshopper and crab have a hard shell covering on the outside of their bodies. This supports their soft bodies inside. We say they have an exoskeleton. But not all invertebrates have an exoskeleton.</p>

<p/>

<p>What about a jellyfish? It does not have a backbone, so it is not a vertebrate, so it must be an invertebrate. Does it have a hard, outer covering called an exoskeleton? Discuss this with your class. Make sure to take note of the third type of skeleton in your discussion. </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Invertebrates do not have a backbone, but  this does not necessarily mean that they have an exoskeleton. Many invertebrates have a<strong> hydrostatic skeleton</strong>, like the jellyfish and earthworm. Some invertebrates such as like the snail and have an exoskeleton (shell) and a hydrostatic skeleton. Sponges actually have a type of endoskeleton as their 'skeletons' are made of calcareous spicules.</p>

<p>When classifying fish we look closely at the material that makes up the skeleton of the fish. This leads us to divide fish into two main groups:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><strong>Cartilaginous fish</strong> have skeletons made of <strong>cartilage</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bony fish</strong> that have skeletons made of bone.</p>
</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>An ancient fish-like class of animals are called Agnatha. Hagfish and Lampreys are part of this group. Hagfish for instance look more like worms than fish. There is controversy over whether hagfish should be classified as fish or not.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What do you notice about the habitat of the young amphibians compared to the adult amphibians? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The young larvae are all in water whereas the adults are on land or near water.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What do you think the larvae need to breathe underwater? What do the adult amphibians need to breathe when they are on land?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The larvae needs gills to breathe in water, the adults have lungs to breathe on land.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Can you now explain why amphibians have a name which comes from two Greek words and means 'double life' or 'both life'? Write your explanation below. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Amphibians have two stages in their life cycle. First, they have the larval stage where they are in water, and then they have the adult stage where they live on land (and also in or near water).</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Amphibians are <strong>ectothermic</strong>. Explain how an amphibian keeps its body warm.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>They get heat from their environment and therefore need to live in areas where it is warm enough for them to have enough body heat to survive. If it gets very cold an amphibian will need to either find a space under a log or leaves, or else sit in the sun.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Most amphibians have a slimy, moist skin. Discuss possible reasons why they need to have this specific type of skin. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learners need to compile a plausible explanation or hypothesis. The correct explanation is: Glands in the skin secrete liquid to keep the skin slimy and moist as frogs may need to use the skin alongside the lungs and mouth for gaseous exchange.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Look at the following image of a caecilian. There is a debate going on in a Gr. 6 class. Some learners think this animal is a worm, making it an invertebrate. Others think it is a snake, making it a vertebrate. What do you think?</p>

<figure><img src="images/gr7ll02-gd-0065.png" width="300" alt="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Adult\_Microcaecilia\_dermatophaga\_in\_life\_-\_journal.pone.0057756.g005-top.png"/><figcaption class="caption">A caecilian. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Adult_Microcaecilia_dermatophaga_in_life_-_journal.pone.0057756.g005-top.png"> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Adult_Microcaecilia_dermatophaga_in_life_-_journal.pone.0057756.g005-top.png </a></figcaption></figure><p>The caecilian is actually an amphibian! What characteristics would you test or make sure this animal displayed to explain to the Gr. 6 learners that it is not a worm. Secondly, what would you need to find out and explain to the learners to explain that it is not a reptile (a snake) but an amphibian?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>In order not to be an invertebrate, like a worm, the animal needs to have a backbone. The caecilian does have a backbone and a skull. The caecilian is not a snake (it is not a reptile) as it has a larval stage which is born in water and it undergoes metamorphosis to become the adult caecilian. The larvae also have gills to breathe underwater. Caecilians also do not have scales like reptiles.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Amphibians lay their eggs in water, like this frog. Why do you think they need to do this? Give two reasons.</p>

                        <figure><img src="images/gr7ll02-gd-0066.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anthonymasi/3373720130/sizes/l/"/><figcaption class="caption">A frog that has just laid its eggs<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anthonymasi/3373720130/sizes/l/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/anthonymasi/3373720130/sizes/l/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Some possible reasons are: The eggs are in water so that when the larvae hatch they are already in the water to swim around, the eggs would dry out if they were not in water, the fertilisation process in amphibians often requires water as the female will lay the eggs and as she does so, the male deposits his sperm is the water around them so they are fertilised.</p>

<p/><p>The ostrich is very big and has a heavy body with long legs. Its long legs help it to run fast on land. It has wings, but its wings are small in comparison to its big heavy body. The albatross is also a big bird but it has a very large wing span relative to its body. The feathers in the albatross are also small and lie close together to help the bird to fly. Whereas the ostrich has many feathers, but they are big and loose and will not catch the updraft of the wind. The penguin also has a body shape which is not designed to help it fly, but rather to swim. It has short, stubby wings, which are not strong enough to lift it off the ground, but are useful for swimming. It is quite fat and heavy, but this helps to keep it warm in the water. The hummingbird is very light and has small wings which beat extremely fast, allowing it to fly and hover. The hummingbird has wings designed to flap quickly in the wind as they are narrow and light, while the penguin has fatter wings shaped like a 
paddle which are rather used for swimming.</p>

<p>Mammals give birth to live young which are fed milk. The milk is produced by the mother's <strong>mammary glands</strong> (in the teats or breasts). Mammals also have hair on their bodies. This varies greatly between mammals. Mammals also have teeth that look different in different parts of the mouth.</p>

<p>All mammals breathe using lungs. Many mammals therefore live on land. Those mammals that do live in water, like whales and dolphins, have to come to the surface of the water to breathe.</p>

<p>Now that we have looked at all the classes of vertebrates, let's have a look at the invertebrates.</p></div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-9">Invertebrates</h3><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>antennae</li>
<li>arthropod</li>
<li>exoskeleton</li>
<li>jointed (segmented) limbs</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>What should you look out for when you have to decide if an animal is an invertebrate?</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>All invertebrates lack a backbone. They either have a hard outer shell or a fluid-filled structure that acts as a skeleton (for example jellyfish and slugs).</li>
<li>All invertebrates are ectothermic.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Did you know that 97% of the animals on Earth are invertebrates? Due to the huge diversity in the invertebrates, it can sometimes make classifying them a bit tricky. The invertebrates are divided into several phyla. Some of the invertebrate phyla are:</p>

<p/>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Molluscs (for example snails and octopuses)</li>
<li>Arthropods (for example insects, spiders and crabs)</li>
<li>Echinoderms (for example sea urchins and starfish)</li>
<li>Cnidaria (for example jellyfish)</li>
<li>Porifera (sponges)</li>
<li>Annelids (segmented worms)</li>
<li>Platyhelminthes (flatworms)</li>
</ol><p/>

<p>There are some other phyla too. As you can see, the invertebrates are a very large and diverse group of animals. We are mostly going to focus on the two phyla Arthropods and Molluscs.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="visit">

</div>
<p/>

<p>The word arthropod comes from two greek words <em>arthron</em> meaning 'joint' and <em>podos</em> meaning 'leg', so together it means 'jointed legs'. Arthropods have an <strong>exoskeleton</strong> and they have jointed (segmented) limbs.</p>

<p/>

<p>Let's now find out more about Arthropods!</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="title">Arthropods</h4>
<p>The invertebrates that fall into the phylum arthropoda, all have a hard outer covering called an <strong>exoskeleton</strong>. The exoskeleton protects the animal and provides a place for its muscles to attach and function.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Classifying arthropods</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>If possible, collect different arthropods in a terrarium and have learners study them with magnifying glasses as they work through the activity. However, photos have been provided if this is not possible. Learners can still be encouraged to study different arthropods in the school premises as they work through the activities. If the school permits this, ask learners to walk around school taking photos with cell phones or cameras of arthropods to share with the class. If the school has access to an interactive whiteboard, put these photos up and use these to complete this activity.</p>

<p>Molluscs are a very diverse phylum of invertebrates. They have a huge range in body shapes and sizes. Molluscs are often given a general description which is that they have internal or external shells and a single muscular 'foot'. However, there are lots of molluscs which do not strictly fit this description, such as slugs.</p>

<p><em>Mollusc</em> is Latin for "soft" which refers to the soft bodies of molluscs.</p>

<p>In this section we will take a closer look at the organisms in the <strong>plant kingdom</strong>. So how do we classify plants?</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This section guides learners as they investigate the plant kingdom by grouping plants with seeds and those without seeds into two main groups.</p>
</div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-11">Classifying plants</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>As an introduction to the diversity of plants, you can do a short walk around your school, aimed at developing a greater awareness of the plants in and around the school, and specifically those that produce seeds and those that do not. Also encourage learners to take note of leaf shape, size, flowers, etc.</p>
</div>
<p>We can easily compare plants based on their characteristics. For example, their leaf size and shape, whether there are flowers or not and how the petals look, the length and depth of the <strong>roots</strong> and the type of root system, and many others.</p>

</div>
<p/>

<p>One particularly useful way is grouping plants according to how they reproduce sexually. If we group plants based on the way that they sexually reproduce we can quickly see two distinct groups:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>Plants with <strong>seeds</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Seedless plants</li>
</ul><p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Plants can also reproduce asexually by making a clone or copy of themselves. In this way new plants can grow from cuttings and tubers (like potatoes), from <strong>bulbs</strong> and <strong>rhizomes</strong>, or from <strong>shoots</strong> and side branches.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Plants that do not produce seeds include ferns, mosses and algae. These plants produce <strong>spores</strong>. The spores often develop in structures found on the underside of the leaves or fronds. The spores grow into new plants.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>If possible, pick some fern fronds to bring to school. You can also look for moss growing in moist environments, such as under a dripping tap and pick some to bring to class. You can then show learners the spore forming structures on the underside of the fern leaves.</p>
</div>

<p>Lichen actually consist of two different organisms growing together! A fungus and a green alga grow together in a <strong>symbiotic</strong> relationship. The fungus absorbs water from the environment and provides the algae with an environment to grow in. The green algae photosynthesizes, providing food for the itself and the fungus. Why can the fungus not make its own food? Is the fungus a plant? Can you come up with a definition for a symbiotic relationship? Discuss this with your class and take some notes. </p><hr/><hr/><p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Alga is singular and algae is plural!</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Discuss this with your learners. Encourage them to take notes in the margins of their workbooks. A fungus is not a plant. Fungi are one of the five kingdoms of organisms. Fungi do not contain chlorophyll and cannot photosynthesize. They therefore need to obtain their nutrients from elsewhere. Ask your learners what they think a symbiotic relationship is. A symbiotic relationship is one in which one or both organisms benefit. A parasite is something which lives off another organism in some way and harms that organism. The relationship benefits the parasite, but not the host. It is not mutually beneficial. On the other hand, the honey bird and the badger, which learners may have learned about in Gr 6, both benefit from their relationship. It is a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. Start by asking learners if the relationship between the fungus and the alga is beneficial to one or both of them? Both the algae and fungus benefit from the relationship. Therefore it is a mutually 
beneficial symbiotic relationship.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The other group of plants produces seeds. These plants can either produce seeds in flowers or they can produce seeds in cones. Most plants that you see around you, produce seeds. Plants that produce seeds in flowers are called <strong>angiosperms</strong> and plants that produce seeds in cones are called <strong>gymnosperms</strong>.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ll02-gd-0123.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scoobygirl/89255754/"/><figcaption class="caption">This is a gymnosperm plant as it produces seeds in cones. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scoobygirl/89255754/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/scoobygirl/89255754/ </a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr7ll02-gd-0124.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lofink/2374856187/"/><figcaption class="caption">This is an angiosperm plant as it produces seeds in flowers. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lofink/2374856187/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/lofink/2374856187/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Have you ever seen a living prehistoric plant? If you thought about it, you probably have without even realising it!</p>

<p/>

<p>In South Africa we have plants called cycads that are often referred to as 'living fossils'. Cycads grew in great numbers during the Jurassic period. They have not been around for as long as ferns and algae, but they have been on Earth for longer than all flowering plants. Flowering plants (angiosperms) evolved after gymnosperms.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>South Africa is considered a diversity hotspot for cycads. Along with Australia,<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"/>Mexico, China and Vietnam, we account for 70% of Earth's cycad species.</p>
</div>

<p>Can you see the large cones in the photo of the cycad above? They are in the centre of the plant. The cones are made up of many individual seeds. Look at the following close up images of cones.</p>

<p>The word gymnosperm means 'naked seed'. Gymnosperms are considered to have naked seeds as the seeds are not covered in a fruit, like we will see in angiosperm plants.</p>

<p/>

<p>Another gymnosperm which is native to South Africa, and grown a lot in the Cape is the Mountain Cypress, as shown in the photo. They grow especially well at high altitudes, such as in the Cederberg Mountains.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7ll02-gd-0130.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A Mountain Cypress.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>There are several species of gymnosperms which are <em>not</em>  indigenous to South Africa. What does this mean? Let's find out.</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>An alien species is one which is not indigenous to South Africa, or a particular geographical area. It has been brought in by humans from another part of the world. They are said to be invasive as they invade (take over) the areas in which indigenous plants grow.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">The species of gymnosperm shown in the photos above are gymnosperms. How do these plants reproduce? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>They are gymnosperms so they reproduce by making seeds in cones.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">In many parts of South Africa, plantations of pine trees are regulated so that they do not impact on the biodiversity of the indigenous plants. But, there are some forests of pine trees which are not used for timber anymore. The Tokai Forest in Cape Town is one of these. Many mountain bikers and runners enjoy doing their activities in this forest. The city of Cape Town started to clear these trees in 2011 so that they could get natural, indigenous fynbos to grow again. There was an outcry from some people as they said their shady riding spot had been ruined. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think Cape Town should be cutting down these trees or not? Give reasons for your answer. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. Learners may either disagree or agree. There are many viewpoints on this at the moment. Perhaps they feel that this is one area which mountain bikers should be allowed to enjoy as a forest as the rest of Table Mountain is covered in fynbos. Alternatively, they may agree that we need to re-establish the local flora and fauna, and although it may take time for a forest and shade to regrow, it will be better in the long run from an ecological point of view.</p>

<p>Let's now take a look at the other group of seed-producing plants, angiosperms.</p></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Angiosperms</h4>
<p>Angiosperms are flowering plants. They produce flowers which develop into seeds that can grow into new flowering plants. We will learn more about reproduction in angiosperms in the next chapter. Most of the plants that you probably see around you in the gardens are flowering plants.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>An idea to introduce this topic is to get sheets of paper and get learners to brainstorm the names of as many flowering plants as possible that they know. As many learners are not that familiar with the names of plants and animals in their area, we encourage teachers to use this to add names of plants as learners get to know them in this section. Encourage learners to review the chart they make and to add to it as they go along. Try and identify as many local examples as possible with your class. This is aimed at showing the diversity of flowering plants in South Africa. You can even cut some flowers to bring in to class.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We can group flowering plants into two major groups:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><strong>monocotyledons</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>dicotyledons</strong></p>
</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>All the angiosperm plants that we are studying have the following characteristics in common:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>roots</li>
<li>stems</li>
<li>leaves</li>
<li>flowers</li>
<li>fruits</li>
<li>seeds</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>A huge thorn tree does not look anything like a maize plant, yet they are both flowering plants. They both have roots, <strong>stems</strong>, leaves and their flowers produce seeds. So why can we group the one as a dicotyledon and the other as a monocotyledon? Let's find out!</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>If possible, bring some examples of monocots and dicots into class for this activity so that learners can study actual examples of the plants. Be sure to include some wind pollinated plants that do not have obvious flowers, as many learners don't realize that grasses form flowers.</p>

<li>Living organisms are sorted and classified according to their shared characteristics.</li>
<li>Many scientists have developed different systems to group and classify the living organisms on earth.</li>
<li>We use a classification system that groups living organisms into five main groups or kingdoms: Bacteria, Protists, Fungi, Plants and Animals</li>
<li>All living organisms have to perform the seven life processes and the way in which they perform these help us to classify them into different groups, putting plants into one group and animals into another for instance.</li>
<li>We can divide a kingdom into smaller and smaller groups, in this order: phyla, classes, orders, families, genera and species.</li>
<li>In the kingdom of animals, we can get two main groups of animals - this with a backbone called vertebrates, and those without a backbone called invertebrates.</li>
<li>The vertebrates are divided into five groups: Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fish and Amphibians.</li>
<li>The invertebrates make up the largest group of animals and there are many thousands of species. We also divide the invertebrates into different groups or phyla like the arthropods, molluscs, sponges and jellyfish, and many others.</li>
<li>Arthropods all have a hard exoskeleton and jointed legs, such as insects, arachnids (spiders) and crustaceans (crabs).</li>
<li>Molluscs have a soft body with or without a shell, such as snails and octopuses.</li>
<li>In the kingdom of plants we also get two main groups: plants that produce seeds and plants that do not produce seeds but spores.</li>
<li>Seedless plants produce spores - like ferns and some mosses.</li>
<li>Seed producing plants can be further divided into angiosperms (seeds in fruit) and gymnosperms (seeds in cones).</li>
<li>Angiosperms can be further divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons.</li>
<li>Monocotyledons have seeds that only have one part or cotyledon. Their stems are herbaceous. The leaves are simple, long and narrow and their flower parts are arranged in multiples of three.</li>
<li>
<p>Dicotyledons have seeds with two parts or cotyledons from which their <strong>tap root</strong> grows deep into the soil. Their stems can be woody or herbaceous. The leaves are varied in shape and size and have a network of <strong>leaf veins</strong>. Flower parts are usually arranged in multiples of four or five.</p>

<p><strong>Concept map</strong></p>

<p>This concept map shows how the concepts in this chapter on Biodiversity link together. Complete the concept map by filling in the five Kingdoms that living things are classified into, and also giving the two major groups of angiosperm plants.</p>

<p/>

<p>Can you see how the arrows show the direction in which you must "read" the concept map?</p>

<p>Teacher's version: Remember that concept maps are different to mind maps in that concept maps have a hierarchical structure and show how concepts link together using arrows and linking words. Whereas mindmaps generally contain a central topic and individual branches coming out which do not necessarily link together. Mindmaps can also be a useful way of summarizing information and studying, however, we are using concept maps as they help to show linkages, which is very important in science. Help your learners to "read" the concept map by showing them that the arrows show the direction in which concepts progress and are linked to each other.</p>
