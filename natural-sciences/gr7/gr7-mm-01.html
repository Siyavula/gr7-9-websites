<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks.</p>

<p>This chapter builds on the chapters about the properties of materials in Gr. 5 and 6 Matter and Materials. Some of the properties learners encountered in the earlier grades are revisited, but now we start placing greater emphasis on how properties that may be desirable in a consumer product, may become undesirable properties when that product turns to waste. New properties introduced are boiling point and melting point, and these are introduced using water as example.</p>

<p>We learnt in Gr. 5 that the properties of a material determine what it can be used for. Can you remember what <em>properties</em> are?</p>

<p/>

</ul></div>
<p/>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">What are properties and why are they important?</h3>
<p/>

<p>You may remember that properties are distinctive characteristics that describe an object or material. For instance, we can describe a metal by saying that it is strong and <strong>durable</strong>. A metal is is also <strong>malleable</strong>. This <strong>property</strong>, malleability, means that a metal can be formed into sheets which can be used for a variety of different purposes. For example, metal sheets can be used  as roof panels for a house, or to press body panels for a car.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Here you could also remind learners of a property they learnt about in Term 2 of Gr. 5. <strong>ductile</strong>: the property of a material that allows it to be drawn out into a wire</p>
</div>

<p>What other properties of metals do you remember? Discuss this as a class.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Metals conduct electricity and heat. Learners may also remember that metals are ductile. (Ductile describes a material which can be drawn out into a wire.)</p>

</div>
<p/>

<p>We can think of certain properties of materials in terms of advantages and disadvantages. Do you know what those are? Let's find out.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners should be encouraged at this stage to start thinking about scientific processes and products in terms of their advantages and disadvantages. This will create awareness that whatever payoff is created by scientific endeavour, one always has to consider the cost. Sometimes the cost is purely financial; at other times the cost may be damage to the individual (as in the case of the irresponsible use of medicines and drugs), or to the environment (some examples follow).</p>
</div>
<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Advantages versus disadvantages</h3>
<p/>

<p>We have seen that strength and durability are desirable properties in some materials. We want things to be strong and to last long. Let's think of an example.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0006.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A black, plastic shopping bag.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Why would plastic shopping bags need to be strong? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners could be encouraged to imagine carrying a shopping bag filled with heavy items, that would simply fall through a shopping bag that is too weak or thin.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Why would plastic shopping bags need to be durable? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners could be encouraged to think in terms of reusing shopping bags.  Encourage them to also think of not-so-obvious uses for old shopping bags, like making artworks or weaving mats for instance.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We call the desirable properties of materials advantages. Disadvantages are unfavourable features, as can be seen in the images of plastic in the environment.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0007.jpg" width="300" alt="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cygnet\_on\_the\_Oxford\_Canal\_-\_geograph.org.uk\_-\_1056892.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">A goose about to eat a plastic bag in a river. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cygnet_on_the_Oxford_Canal_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1056892.jpg"> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cygnet_on_the_Oxford_Canal_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1056892.jpg </a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0008.jpg" width="300" alt="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plastic\_left\_in\_the\_sand\_near\_the\_Hilton\_Hawaiian\_Village.\_.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">These plastic rings from soft drink packaging are very dangerous in the wild as they can entangle an animal's neck. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plastic_left_in_the_sand_near_the_Hilton_Hawaiian_Village._.jpg"> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Plastic_left_in_the_sand_near_the_Hilton_Hawaiian_Village._.jpg </a></figcaption></figure><p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>When we throw a shopping bag away, its durability may mean that it takes years and years to break down, so it pollutes the environment for a long period of time. Its strength may mean that, when an animal becomes entangled in a piece of plastic that has been thrown away, the plastic would be too strong for the animal to escape from. The animal may eventually die as a result.</p>
</div>

<p/>

<p>The following activity has another example of advantages versus disadvantages.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Advantages versus disadvantages</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is an optional activity.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Can you imagine a car made of solid gold? A car like this would be very valuable!</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Look at the image of a gold car then answer the questions that follow.</li>
<li>Discuss some of the questions with your classmates before writing down your answers.</li>
</ol><p/>
<figure id="gd-idp15627792"><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0009.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What are your feelings about the golden car in the picture? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. Encourage learners to write what they think of the golden car, what their thoughts and feelings are. Do they think it looks great? Would they like to own one?</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What are the advantages of having a car made of gold? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>A practical advantage is that gold doesn't rust. To some people, it may be important to display their wealth to everyone else.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Do you think a golden car would be very strong? Would it perhaps be safer in the event of an accident? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Allow learners to debate this for a short while. You may want to point out that gold is actually quite a soft metal, and that driving a golden car would not offer more protection to the passengers than a car which has an exterior made mostly of steel would. Avoid the misconception that cars are made entirely out of steel. Cars have crumple zones to increase safety.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What are the disadvantages of a car made of gold? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Gold is very expensive, and so the car would be unaffordable to most people. Gold is also very heavy (learners may need to be reminded of this), so the car would be heavy to move around. It would require lots of fuel to make it move and fuel is expensive. It would probably also scratch easily. Some learners may also say that because it is so valuable, it might get stolen. You could add that it could be insured against theft, but that insurance on a car this valuable would be very expensive. The conclusion is that although a gold car may seem like a nice idea, it is not practical or safe or fuel efficient.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p/>

<p/>

<p>We always have to weigh up the advantages against the disadvantages when we choose materials for a particular job.</p>

<p/>

<p>How would you test how strong a material is? Let's imagine you have different types of paper. How would you test which paper is the strongest? Discuss this as a class and write some notes on the lines provided. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Encourage learners to make their own notes as you are talking in class as this is a valuable skill. They can do it either here in the workbook or in a separate notebook if you make use of these. Some points to guide the class discussion:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Something that is durable lasts long.</li>
<li>Learners may say that something is strong when it is difficult to break.</li>
<li>Allow learners to discuss how to test how strong a material is for a few minutes and come up with a few ideas.</li>
<li>Learners may say the paper that is most difficult to tear would be the strongest.</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>The strength of paper is important because we use paper for many different things.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0010.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">All these objects are made from different types of paper with different properties that suit the function of the object.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>In the next activity we are going to investigate the tearing strength of different types of paper.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Which type of paper is the strongest?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners can help you prepare for the activity by bringing different types of paper to school: newspaper, tissue paper, paper towel, or old magazines and gift wrap. Tell them to bring the biggest pieces they can find.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To compare the tearing strengths of different types of paper.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>You could let the learners cut the paper into strips of 20 x 5 cm each, or you could do this beforehand to save time. Learners will compare the force required to tear the different types of paper. They have not yet encountered force as a concept (force is covered in Gr 9 Energy and Change) but you could encourage them to think about what they are doing when they hang the heavy marbles on the strip of paper.  For example, ask learners: "What do more marbles in the yoghurt tub mean?" It means the yoghurt tub is heavier, and `pulls' harder on the strip of paper. (If you cannot get hold of marbles you could try finding small stones or pebbles that are more or less the same size. You would just have to explain to the learners that the stones do not all have a mass of 5 grams, but you will imagine that they do to simplify the calculations.)</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong></p>

<p>When you write  a hypothesis, you must state what you think will happen in your investigation. </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Possible hypotheses are: 'The thicker and stronger the paper, the more marbles it can hold before breaking.', 'Paper X is the strongest', where X is one of the papers supplied.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>strips of different types of paper (20cm x 5cm)</li>
<li>hole puncher</li>
<li>strong paper clips</li>
<li>yoghurt tub</li>
<li>marbles</li>
<li>string</li>
<li>hand lens (optional)</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Make sure to use strong paper clips so that they do not bend under the strain of the marbles during the investigation. Make sure to use a range of papers, such as filter paper, tissue paper, crepe paper, wax paper, newspaper, normal white paper, harder card, etc. A suggestion is to also number the pieces of paper so that learners can easily reference them and then use the number to place them in order of strength later on in the questions. If you have time you can also test some other materials such as plastic shopping bags or aluminium foil.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>You can introduce the idea of a fair test here. Ask learners why they think they should punch the holes the same distance from the edge in each type of paper. This is because you want it to be a fair test - each piece of paper must be tested fairly and equally. If the holes were punched at different distances from the edge, this might make some papers appear stronger or weaker than they actually are. You need to control all other variables so that the only thing you are changing is the type of paper.</p>
</div><ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Punch a hole at both ends of each paper strip. This is so that you can test the paper twice on each side. Make sure that the holes are in the middle, and also at the same distance from the end of each strip. This will make it a fair test.</li>
<li>Form the paper clip into an S-shape and hang it from the hole in the paper.</li>
<li>Make a handle for the yoghurt tub, using the string.</li>
<li>Hang the yoghurt tub from the paper clip and hold it in your hand.</li>
<li>Add marbles one-by-one to the yoghurt tub until the paper tears. Count the number of marbles in the tub. (Tip: Place the marbles very gently into the yoghurt tub or the shock of dropping them in might tear the paper).</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 - 5 using the other end of the strip and count the marbles again. Take the average of the number of marbles.</li>
<li>Repeat this using the other strips of paper, doing each twice and taking the averages.</li>
<li>If each marble has a mass of 5 grams, work out the mass in grams that was needed to tear each strip of paper and write the number in the final column of your table.</li>
<li>If you have time, you can also test different kinds of materials, such as a plastic shopping bag, aluminium foil or plastic wrap.</li>
</ol><figure id="gd-idp7924048"><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0011.png" width="250"/></figure><p>Tip: To calculate the <strong>average</strong> of a set of numbers, you add all the numbers together and then divide by how many numbers there were in the set. In this investigation, you will add the number of marbles together for each time you tested the paper strength (this was twice for each strip of paper) and then divide by 2 to calculate the average number of marbles that each piece of paper can hold before it tears.</p>

<p>For example, if you had 5 marbles in the first attempt, and 3 marbles in the second attempt, the average will be calculated as follows:</p>

<p>\(5+3=8\) marbles</p>

<p>\(8\div{}2=4\) marbles on average</p>

<p>Therefore, the paper type could hold an average of 4 marbles.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION:</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>Let's now analyse and think about the results of the investigation.</p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What do you think causes one paper to be stronger than another? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>More than one factor play a role here, but generally paper that is thicker tends to be stronger. This is because the layer of fibers is thicker, so more fibers to cling to each other. Papers in which the fibers are longer and more tightly packed are also stronger, and coating the paper with a super thin layer of plastic also adds additional strength. Learners could be encouraged to look for signs of these treatments.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>How would you modify the investigation to test the strength of different types of plastic? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Plastics are generally stronger than paper, so for a start, the testing method should allow for greater weights to be hung from the plastic strips. This is a good opportunity to introduce the notion of fair testing: As many variables as possible should be kept the same: length of the plastic strips, method of fastening the weight to the plastic strips, etc.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
            
<p>What did you do to ensure fair testing? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>We used paper strips of the same length and width.</li>
<li>We punched identical holes in all the different paper strips.</li>
<li>We punched the hole in exactly the same place on all the strips.</li>
<li>We used the same method to hang the marbles from the paper strip for all the different types of paper.</li>
<li>We repeated each measurement (by testing both sides of the paper strip).</li>
</ul></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>How would you modify the investigation to test the flexibility of different types of materials? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. One suggestion might be to cut strips of the same size of the materials to be tested, and lay them across the edge of a table, hang a weight on the overhanging edge and find a way to measure the amount of flexing that occurs. Learners could discuss ways of ensuring the test is fair.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why did you repeat the experiment for the same type of paper? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>It is important to repeat experiments to be sure you get the same/similar answers every time. Repeating an experiment and calculating an average value helps to eliminate errors, or results that arise by chance (or luck). We say it makes the answer more reliable.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>

<p>What can you conclude from this investigation? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Possible conclusions include: 'The stronger the paper, the more marbles it can hold before tearing', or 'Paper X is the strongest as it can hold the most marbles before tearing and paper Y is the weakest', etc.</p>
</div></div>

<p/>

<p>Strength, <strong>flexibility</strong> (the ability to flex or bend), electrical conductivity and heat conductivity are important properties of materials that we learnt about in Gr. 5 and have revised again here.</p>

<p/>

<p>Can you think of materials that are both strong and flexible? Most people will immediately think of plastics! Most plastics can easily be melted and <strong>moulded</strong> into different shapes for different purposes. Why do you think plastics can be 'melted and moulded' with ease? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Most plastics melt easily because they melt at relatively low temperatures. We say they have <em>low melting points</em>. Note that this is not true for all plastics.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0012.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">All of these items are made of plastic in different shapes, sizes and colours.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>We are going to learn about two new properties of materials, namely boiling point and melting point.</p>

<p/>

<p>First, let's check if everyone knows that there is a difference between the words heat and temperature. The two words, heat and temperature, are connected but they do not mean the same thing:</p>

<p/>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li><strong>Heat</strong> is the transfer of energy from one object to another. This happens because of the difference in temperature between the two objects. The transfer of energy will be from the hotter object to the cooler object until they are the same temperature. You cannot measure heat directly, but you can detect its effect on a substance. Changes in heat can usually be detected as changes in temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Temperature</strong> is used to describe how hot or cold something is. Temperature can be measured directly with a thermometer.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Adding heat energy usually results in a temperature rise, so people often confuse heat and temperature. But they are not the same thing! We will look more at heating as a transfer of energy next term in Energy and Change.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-4">Boiling and melting points</h3>
<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>temperature</li>
<li>thermometer</li>
<li>heat</li>
<li>melting point</li>
<li>boiling point</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>Do you remember learning about the state changes in previous grades? We will be focusing on boiling and melting in this section. Have a look at the following diagram to refresh your memories about the different changes of state between solids, liquids and gases.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp8150384"><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0013.jpg" width="300"/></figure><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Melting is when a solid changes into a liquid. Look at this photo of a candle burning. What is happening to the wax around the flame? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The wax is melting.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Discuss with your partner why you think this is happening to the wax. Write your answer below. </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Discuss this with your class. The heat energy from the flame on the burning wick is transferred to the wax causing the temperature of the wax to rise. When the temperature gets to a certain point (called its <strong>melting point</strong>), the wax starts to melt as it changes state from a solid to a liquid.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0014.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skyseeker/20220695/"/><figcaption class="caption">A burning candle. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/skyseeker/20220695/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/skyseeker/20220695/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>As you can see in the previous diagram, a liquid can change into a gas by evaporation. For example if you leave a saucer of water out in the sun, the water will evaporate. Evaporation can take place at any temperature. But, in boiling, the liquid needs to be heated to reach its <strong>boiling point</strong>. Bubbles of water vapour then form in the liquid and rise up.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>There are some important differences between evaporation and boiling. Evaporation can take place <em>below</em> the boiling point of a liquid, but boiling takes place only once the liquid is heated and reaches its <em>boiling point</em>. Also, evaporation occurs at the <em>surface of a liquid</em> as <em>individual</em> particles gain enough energy to overcome the forces holding them in the liquid and become individual particles in the gas state. Boiling occurs <em>within the liquid</em> when enough particles <em>escape en masse and form bubbles</em> of gas in the liquid. The gas bubbles then rise to the surface of the liquid and the liquid is said to boil.</p>

<p/>

<p>Can you think of at least three different ways to boil water? Discuss this with your class and write your answer down. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>Write a short story to explain what you think happened to the kettle in the picture. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Just a few sentences are required here. The learners should note that someone placed the plastic kettle on the stove. When the person tried to heat the water, the kettle melted as a result of contact with the flame/heat. The kettle is meant to be plugged in to heat the water.</p>

<p>Why do you think the person made the mistake of heating the kettle on the stove? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learners can come up with their own reasons here. Perhaps the person was used to heating water on the stove in a metal kettle. Perhaps the person did not know that the plastic would melt. Perhaps the person was just absent-minded and made a mistake.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Do you think plastic is a good choice of material for making a whole cooking pot? Why do you say so? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>No. Plastic is not a good choice because it melts when it is heated above a certain temperature.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why does a plastic kettle not melt when we boil water in it? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The water boils at a temperature that is lower than the temperature needed to melt the plastic of the kettle.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
	    
<p>Sometimes, just the handles of the cooking pot are made from plastic or wood. Why do you think this is so? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>This is because wood and plastic are not good conductors of heat, unlike metal, and so you can 	pick up the pot easily.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is also an extension question as we have not specifically dealt with heat conductivity yet in this grade, but it has been covered in previous grades.</p>

<p/>

<p>At what temperature does water boil? We are going to do an investigation to find out! Since we have to make temperature measurements in the investigation, we are going to first check if everyone knows how temperature is measured.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Some learners may know that water boils at a temperature around 100&#176;C (100 degrees Celsius), depending on factors such as altitude above sea level and atmospheric pressure. Do not answer this question directly, but rather use it to introduce the next activity.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Have you ever been so sick that you had a fever? Have you ever had your temperature taken?</p>

<p/>

<p>Perhaps you have had your temperature taken with a <strong>thermometer .</strong>A thermometer can be used to find out how hot or cold something is. A thermometer is an instrument for measuring temperature.</p>

<p>Here is an optional, extension activity on how a thermometer works. It links to what learners will do in Gr 8 Matter and Materials. Next year, learners will look at the Particle Model of Matter, and within this, cover density and the contraction and expansion of materials. However, this is a good extension exercise to get learners thinking about how a thermometer works and introduce the idea that materials <strong>expand</strong> (when heated) and <strong>contract</strong> (when cooled) due to the increase in kinetic energy of the particles (the size and number of the particles do not change, it is only the spaces between the particles that get bigger or smaller).</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> An exception is water which actually expands when it becomes a solid (ice). This will be covered in detail in later grades.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>Activity: How does a thermometer work?</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>The common glass thermometer that you see in the image is called a bulb thermometer. All bulb thermometers consist of a fairly large bulb, connected to a long thin tube. The thermometer usually contains some type of brightly coloured liquid. Liquids take up less space when they are cold and more space when they are warm; we say they contract when they are cooled and expand when they are warmed.</p>

<p>Let's now investigate boiling and melting.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">What is the boiling point of water?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The investigation in the learners books includes only that of investigating boiling point of water, as suggested in CAPS. However, if you would also like to look at melting point of ice, this second part has been included in the teachers guide later.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To observe boiling and to determine the boiling point of water.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>CAPS suggests that this investigation could be performed on `other liquids' such as orange juice, apple juice and cola. One issue to be aware of is that the suggested beverages are all solutions of substances<em>in water</em>. Their boiling points will be slightly higher than that of pure water, but this is because adding some substances to water elevates the boiling point of the solution. It is still water that is boiling in all these instances (the phenomenon is called <em>boiling point elevation</em>).  Sometimes, adding substances (such as ethanol) to water can bring the boiling point down (refer to Raoult's Law). This is a lot of detail and not necessary for the learners to know about at this stage.</p>

<p/>

<p>Here are some suggestions for extensions for this investigation:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Determining the boiling point of methanol (methylated spirits) or ethanol (available as 'surgical spirits' from the pharmacy). The point of this extension would be to show that different substances have different boiling points.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> Methylated spirits can be used instead of methanol but it only contains about 9.5 % methanol in more than 80 % ethanol. This means there may not be a big difference between the experiments carried out with ethanol and methylated spirits.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Take care when working with these substances, especially methanol, since it is dangerous. Wear gloves if possible, and avoid inhaling the fumes. Furthermore, ethanol and methanol are both extremely flammable and care should be taken when heating them. A safe way of heating ethanol or methanol to its boiling point is shown in the following diagram. The test tube containing the ethanol or methanol should be suspended in a beaker of tap water, and slowly heated. The principle of thermal equilibrium means that the water and ethanol/methanol will be at the same temperature, so the temperature of the water can be substituted for the temperature of the ethanol/methanol.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp17989152"><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0018.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Determining the boiling point of water by another method, for instance in a pot on the stove, or in a kettle. The point of this would be to show that the boiling point of water is constant (at constant pressure, of course, so it would make sense to do the extensions concurrently with the prescribed procedure below).</li>

<p><strong>RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS:</strong></p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Perhaps you measured the boiling point of the water as slightly less than 100&#176;C. This does not mean that your measurements were incorrect. The boiling point of water depends on the atmospheric pressure. At sea level (close to the ocean) water boils at 100&#176;C. Water boils at a lower temperature at higher<strong>altitudes</strong> (for example, on a mountain) because the air pressure is less.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Record your results in the table.</p>

<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>The title of your graph should be: <strong>Determining the boiling point of water</strong>.</li>
<li>The independent variable should be 'Time'. Label the axis, and use minutes as units.  Remember that the<strong> independent variable</strong> should always be drawn on the horizontal axis of your graph, or the x-axis.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners should be reminded that the independent variable is the one that was `manipulated'; in this case the total amount of energy added to the water increased with time. Since we have no real measure of the energy added to the water, but since we do know that the energy was added at a constant rate, we can use the <strong>time</strong> that the water was heated as our independent variable.</p>
</div><ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>The dependent variable should be 'Temperature'. Label the axis, and use degrees Celsius (&#176;C) as units. The <strong>dependent variable</strong> should always be drawn on the vertical axis of your graph; this is the y-axis.</li>

<p>The boiling point of water also depends on the purity of the water. Water which contains impurities (such as salt or sugar) boils at a higher temperature than pure water. This is why orange juice or apple juice will boil at temperatures slightly above 100&#176;C.</p>

<li>Do step 3 one more time.</li>
<li>
<p>Take some of the ice pieces and drop them into the beaker. Swirl the ice with a small amount of water for about 20 seconds and then measure the temperature of the ice-water-mixture in the beaker. Is it different from the original temperature of the ice?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The purpose of this question is to make learners realise that melting and freezing are the reverse of each other. The phase transition between water and ice (liquid and solid water) always occurs at 0&#176;C (in pure water).</p>

          </li>
</ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> Once again, this has been included to bring learners to the realisation that a fixed amount of energy will be needed to melt a fixed amount of ice. Heating the ice with a burner simply delivers the energy at a faster rate, so melting occurs sooner. Melting occurs at the melting point which is 0&#176;C. The melting point is not affected.</p>

<p>Ice melts at 0&#176;C. Water freezes at 0&#176;C. Coincidence, or not?</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We will learn more about changes of state in Gr. 8 Matter and Materials. In order to melt ice, we need to add energy to it to raise the temperature to <strong>melting point</strong>. However, if we want to freeze water, we need to remove (take out) energy from it until the temperature decreases to freezing point.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp10899536"><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0025.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>Does boiling have a reverse process? Boiling is when liquid water changes to water vapour or steam. The reverse process, when steam turns back to water, is called condensation. In order to boil water, we need to add energy to it. But if we want to condense the water vapour, we need to cool it down (take energy out of it).</p>

<figure id="gd-idp8623680"><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0027.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>In words, the summary of the diagram is:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Boiling occurs when a liquid turns to a gas at boiling point.</li>
<li>Water boils at a temperature of 100&#176;C when the air pressure equals 1 atmosphere. This is called the normal boiling point of water.</li>
<li>When water is heated, its temperature will rise until the water starts to boil. While the water is boiling the temperature will remain constant.</li>
<li>Melting occurs when a solid turns to a liquid.</li>
<li>Ice (the solid form of water) melts at a temperature of 0&#176;C. This is called the melting point of ice. This is also called the freezing point of water.</li>
<li>When ice is heated, its temperature will remain constant until all the ice has melted. Only then will the temperature of the water (that was ice before it melted) rise above 0&#176;C.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Ask your learners what 'room temperature' is and if they can find room temperature on the diagram? Get them to mark where it is on the diagram. Room temperature is 25&#176;C. Once they have located where this is on the diagram, ask them what state water will be at 25&#176;C? Water is a liquid at 25&#176;C.</p>

<p>Do all liquids boil at 100&#176;C? No, of course not! Not all substances melt at 0&#176;C either.</p>

<p>So far we have seen that materials have different properties such as their strength, their flexibility and their melting and boiling points. These properties determine how these different materials are used.</p>

<p/>

<p>We also briefly mentioned how some materials can conduct heat better than others. This is called heat conductivity. Think of some objects which you want to be able to conduct heat well and what material they should be made of. Write some of your ideas down. </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Possible answers are the metal of cooking pots conducts heat well to cook food and boil water, the metals that make up some heaters also need to conduct heat well.</p>
</div>
<p>Why do you think you put a jersey on when you are cold? What can we say about the wool that the jersey is made from in terms of heat conductivity? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The wool or fabric that the jersey is made of does not conduct heat well. It therefore acts as a heat insulator, keeping the body warm.</p>

<p>We will learn more about heat transfer later in the year. Another property of materials is how well they can conduct electricity. This is called electrical conductivity. We will look more at how different materials can be used as electrical insulators (meaning they do not conduct electricity well), later in the year.</p></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Impact on the environment</h2><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>impact</li>

What effects do you think this has had on the environment? </p><hr/><hr/><figure><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0030.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vaizha/8524241048/"/><figcaption class="caption">The Premier Diamond Mine outside of Pretoria. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vaizha/8524241048/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/vaizha/8524241048/ </a></figcaption></figure></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The local habitats are affected by the digging of the hole, the roads that are built and the other infrastructure put in place. Diamond mines require huge amounts of diesel which produce greenhouse gases which build up in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>In this photograph, the 2010 World Cup Soccer Stadium can be seen in the centre. In the top left are huge areas called slag piles. These are huge piles of crushed rock left over from decades of gold mining. What impact do you think this has on this area? </p><hr/><hr/><figure><img src="images/gr7mm01-gd-0031.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/4691437306/"/><figcaption class="caption">An aerial view of the Soccer City Stadium and surrounding area. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/4691437306/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/gsfc/4691437306/ </a></figcaption></figure></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p><strong>Note:</strong> Learners may battle with this question so you can ask them if they think anything can grow or live on these dumps again?</p>

        
<p>As can be seen, these slag piles do not have anything growing on them as they are not green, and they have been there for decades, so they are reducing the possibilities for habitats and natural vegetation to grow back. The rock can contain toxic chemicals (such as cyanide) which seep into the ground and contaminate soil and water.</p>

<p>Coal mining in South Africa also has a major impact on the environment. Not only the mining, but the use of coal in power stations has negative impacts. What are some of these? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Huge amounts of land are destroyed when mining coal. Coal mining also requires large amounts of water, which reduces the water for surrounding areas. Water runoff can also contaminate water supplies. There is air pollution in coal mining and in the use of coal in power stations. when coal is burning, greenhouse gases are released which contribute to acid rain formation and the greenhouse effect. It also contaminates the air for other organisms.</p>

<p><strong>Paper making:</strong></p>

<p>Can you imagine your world without paper? Probably not! We use it every day of our lives. South Africa has a big paper-making industry. Although paper is important in our lives today, the production has negative impacts on the environment.</p>

<p>Huge areas of land are used to plant the trees that are then harvested to make pulp and then paper. What impact do you think this has on the environment? Hint: Also think about what you learnt about in Life and Living about biodiversity. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Plantations take up a lot of space and therefore natural, indigenous vegetation has to be cleared (deforestation). This destroys habitats for other organisms. These trees also use a lot of water and prevent anything from growing underneath them. They reduce the biodiversity in the area.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Look at the photo of the paper-making factory. What effects does this have on the environment? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>There is a huge amount of air pollution from paper-making factories, which contributes to a build up in greenhouse gases. Paper mills use huge amounts of water, and the waste water contains many chemicals and substances which damage the environment.</p>
