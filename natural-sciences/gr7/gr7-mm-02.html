<p>'Mixtures' was first introduced in Gr. 6, so learners should already be familiar with these concepts. Learners would have also looked at some of the physical methods of separating different types of mixtures (including hand sorting, sieving, filtration), and this year we will explore some additional methods in more detail (including distillation and chromatography).</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>In the first section of this chapter, learners will learn how to identify mixtures. One of the central ideas in this section is that the components in a mixture are not chemically joined. They still exist as separate compounds that have not reacted with each other in any way. For that reason, mixtures can be separated using physical methods. Physical methods can not be used to separate elements that are chemically joined.</p>

<p/>

<p>In order to make this section more interesting you could provide small samples of each of the mixtures discussed and ask learners to draw them, paying close attention to any features that a particular mixture may have. When they are faced with a solution (water and sugar, for instance) they might notice that there are no visible features to draw. This will help establish in their minds that solutions are mixtures where the substances are so intimately mixed (literally on the level of individual particles) that we cannot make out separate substances anymore.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>What does it mean to <em>mix</em> something? Can you mime an explanation (that means you have to explain without saying a single word!)</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Get your learners to act out the word 'mix'. Learners might make stirring motions with their arms. This exercise may seem trivial but their attention will immediately be focussed (and their learning enhanced) if they are engaged in this way. Using gestures that require learners to move their bodies has been shown to enhance learning even at university level!</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Is it possible to mix water? Discuss this with your class.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Some learners may say no, you need two or more things mixed together to have a mixture. Other learners may answer that it is possible to mix hot water with cold water. Point out that the end result would just be water, and not really a mixture of hot and cold water; once mixed, the water would have the same temperature throughout.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>One substance alone cannot be a mixture. A <strong>mixture</strong> is made up of two or more different substances.</p>

<p/>

<p>A mixture can contain solids, liquids and/or gases. The components in a mixture are not chemically joined; they are just mixed. That means we do not need to use chemical reactions to separate them. Mixtures can be separated using physical methods alone and that is what this chapter is all about: how to separate mixtures.</p>

<p/>

<p>There are many different kinds of mixtures. Before we learn how to separate them, it is worth looking at all the different kinds of mixtures briefly.</p>

<p/>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">Different kinds of mixtures</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is a revision of the types of mixtures that one can get, which has been done in Gr. 6 Matter and Materials. If you feel your learners have already grasped this, you can go through it briefly by just looking at the different pictures provided and ask learners what types of mixtures they are.</p>

<div class="section"><h4 class="title">A mixture of a solid and a solid</h4>
<p/>

<p>Can you think of an example of a mixture of a solid and a solid? Soil is an example of a mixture of solids. What are the substances found in soil? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Soil can contain clay, sand and small pebbles. Soil can also contain bits of plant matter. Clay and dust particles are very small, and sand particles are larger. Pebbles are even larger.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0001.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eggrole/7373500718/"/><figcaption class="caption">Soil is a mixture of different components. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eggrole/7373500718/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/eggrole/7373500718/ </a></figcaption></figure></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">A mixture of a solid and a liquid</h4>
<p/>

<p>What happens when clay or sand is mixed with water? Would you be able to see through a mixture of clay and water? The mixture of clay or sand with water is muddy. The small clay particles become suspended in the water. This kind of mixture is called a <strong>suspension</strong>. Suspensions are <strong>opaque</strong>; that means they are cloudy and we cannot see through them very well.</p>

<p/>

<p>What happens when sugar is mixed with water? Does the mixture become muddy? Why not? The sugar dissolves in the water and the mixture is called a <strong>solution</strong>. Solutions are <strong>clear</strong>; that means we can see through them.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Keep in mind that some mixtures that we expect to be solutions end up being suspensions. A good example is table salt and water that could end up looking cloudy because of the starch (free-flowing agent). In this case it would be better to use pure sea salt. (You could also use this apparent paradox as the basis of an extension activity about what appearances allow us to infer in certain situations.)</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0002.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Can you see the difference between an opaque suspension of sand and clay in water (on the left) and a clear solution of sugar in water on the right?</figcaption></figure><p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">A mixture of a solid and a gas</h4>
<p/>

<p>Have you ever seen smoke from a fire? What is the smoke made of? Do you think it is a mixture? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Smoke is actually made of tiny solid lumps of soot and ash and dust that mix with the air (which is a gas) and water vapour (also a gas). That makes smoke a mixture of one or more solids and gases.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0003.jpg" width="300" alt="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Universal\_Fire\_Smoke.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">The black smoke from a burning building. <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Universal_Fire_Smoke.jpg"> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Universal_Fire_Smoke.jpg </a></figcaption></figure><p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">A mixture of a liquid and a liquid</h4>
<p/>

<p>Milk is not a single substance, but actually a mixture of two liquids! The one liquid component in milk is water, and the other is fatty oil. The reason milk is opaque is that tiny droplets of the oil is suspended in the water. Can you remember what a mixture is called when a solid is suspended in liquid? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>We use milk as an example of a suspension, however, milk is actually more complex since it also contains solutes. It is a great example of a mixture that has both solution and suspension (emulsion) components. Flour or maizena mixed with water also makes a good suspension which settles after some time. This is also a good opportunity to revise the terms solute, solvent and solution, namely the solute (for example sugar) is the substance that is dissolved in the solvent (for example water) to form a solution (for example sugar water).</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>When some liquids are suspended in liquid, we call the mixture an <strong>emulsion</strong>. Like suspensions, emulsions tend to be opaque.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0004.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A clear, transparent solution on the left and an opaque emulsion on the right</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Are all liquid-liquid mixtures emulsions? (One way to recognise an emulsion is that it is opaque). Are all liquid-liquid mixtures opaque? Can you think of a liquid-liquid mixture that is not an emulsion? Discuss this with your class and give an answer below. </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Firstly, no, not all liquid-liquid mixtures are opaque. Secondly, most solutions that learners will be able to think of are essentially solid-liquid mixtures at the fundamental level. It is good enough for learners at this level to offer examples of liquid-liquid mixtures such as 'a mixture of apple juice and water'.</p>

<p/>

<p>A better example of a liquid-liquid solution is vinegar, which is a mixture of ethanoic acid (acetic acid) - a liquid at room temperature - and water. This example might be a sensible inclusion since it would serve as early introduction to households acids that will feature prominently in the next chapter (Acids and Bases). If learners are given a vinegar sample to draw, it would be better to provide a sample of white vinegar, since it contains less solid matter. Once again they will be confronted with the realisation that the solution does not have visible features. Another opportunity to establish that solutions are mixtures where the substances are so intimately mixed that we cannot make out separate substances anymore.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>A mixture of vinegar and water is clear, and that is a clue that the mixture is a <strong>solution</strong>.</p>

<p/>

<p>Solutions are special kinds of mixtures in which the particles are <em>so well mixed</em> that they are not separated from each other. We cannot make out separate substances anymore - everything looks the same when we look with the naked eye.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The particle model of matter will only be dealt with in detail in Gr. 8, but the following kinds of visual representations may aid understanding of abstract concepts. You can draw these on the board with different colours. Learners were exposed to similar images in Gr. 6. However, it is not critical at this stage and you do not need to go into detail. Solutions look glassy/translucent, and the solid particles cannot be seen. The substances cannot be separated by filtration (dealt with later in this chapter).</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0005.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Particles in a solution. Notice that the blue particles are more or less evenly spaced amongst the white ones.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0006.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Particles in a suspension or emulsion. Notice that the blue particles are present in little clumps or clusters amongst the white ones.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>In a suspension, one of the substance's particles are always clumped together. Sometimes one can even see little globs of oil (in the case of an emulsion) or little lumps of solid (in the case of a suspension) suspended in the liquid.</p>
</div></div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">A mixture of a gas and a gas</h3>
<p/>

<p>We learnt in Gr. 6 Matter and Materials that the particles of gases are far apart. This means that gases can mix very easily, because it is easy for their particles to move in amongst each other. The air we breathe is not a single gas but actually a mixture of gases! Do you know what the two most <strong>abundant</strong> components are? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Nitrogen gas and oxygen gas. Learners may say oxygen and carbon dioxide; nitrogen is actually the main component of air (roughly 80%) followed by oxygen (roughly 18%). Carbon dioxide is present in much smaller quantity.</p>
</div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">A mixture of a liquid and a gas</h4>
<p/>

<p>Do you remember that we discussed boiling in the previous chapter (Properties of Materials)? What happens to a liquid when it boils? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The liquid turns to a gas.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Can you see the water vapour in the following picture of a boiling kettle? Point to it with your finger. Discuss this with your teacher and classmates and when you have agreed on an answer, draw an arrow onto the picture to indicate the water vapour.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm24369024"><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0007.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>A suggestions is to do a demonstration of this in class if you can get a kettle and plug it in to show learners the colourless steam at the spout of the kettle. Learners may point to the cloud in front of the kettle. This is not actually water vapour, which would be invisible to the human eye. The cloud forms when the water vapour cools down sufficiently to condense into micro-droplets that are visible to the human eye.</p>

<p/>

<p>We will only see the water when it starts to condense. When the water particles condense, they become liquid water again. That means the particles start clinging together in tiny micro-droplets, which grow into larger droplets when they come together. The small cloud of in front of the kettle is actually a cloud of micro-droplets of liquid water suspended in air. This is an example of a liquid suspended in a gas.</p>

<p/>

<p>The image below indicates where the arrow should be drawn:</p>
<figure id="gd-idm18463920"><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0008.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Can we see most gases? Why do you think so? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Most gases are colourless and cannot be seen. We cannot see individual particles as they are too small. However, some gases (such as Chlorine and Fluorine) can be seen because they are coloured.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Clouds and fog or mist are all examples of tiny water droplets suspended in air.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>An artists, Berndnaut Smilde, uses a fog machine to make small clouds inside a room which only last a few seconds. A wonderful example of science as art!<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.berndnaut.nl/works.htm"> http://www.berndnaut.nl/works.htm</a></p>

<p>We have learnt that mixtures can be made of substances in the same state or in different states. The following activity will help us apply our new knowledge about mixtures to more examples.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Types of mixtures</h1>
<p/>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Look at the list of mixtures. Discuss in your group, or with your partner, what each mixture consists of.</li>
<li>Identify the type of substances (solid, liquid or gas) that are mixed in each of the examples on the list.</li>
<li>Write the name of each example in the appropriate block on the diagram.</li>
</ol><p/>

<p>Mixtures:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>air</li>
<li>smoke</li>
<li>hair oil (emulsion of oil and water)</li>
<li>clear fruit juice (eg. apple juice)</li>
<li>cloudy apple juice</li>
<li>salty water</li>
<li><strong>alloys</strong> such as brass (used for coins) and stainless steel (used for rust-resistant metal items)</li>
<li>foam plastic (like the material used for making mattresses and pillows)</li>
<li>spray deodorant</li>
<li>air freshener (aerosol type)</li>
<li>paint</li>
<li>dust cloud</li>
<li>soil</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>For instance, sugar dissolved in water would go in the middle block of the bottom row, to show that it is a solid (sugar) mixed with a liquid (water).</p>

<p/>

<p>Why do we make mixtures? Mixtures have many uses: perhaps we are mixing ingredients to bake a cake, or mixing metals to make a really strong alloy.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0010.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A cake is a mixture of ingredients, including flour, eggs and milk.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Many things around us occur naturally as mixtures: salty sea water, moist air, soil, compost, rocks (mixture of minerals) to name a few. Many mixtures are man made, for instance; Coca Cola, paint, salad dressing and so forth.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>You can ask your learners what we use paint for. Paint is used to cover walls and other surfaces. Sometimes we want to protect these surfaces against water or wind (for instance when we are painting an outside wall or roof) and sometimes we just want to make them look attractive (for instance when we paint an inside wall, or when we create a beautiful artwork). The water or oil in the paint helps us to spread the pigments more evenly over the surface that we want to cover and binds the pigments tightly so that the paint forms a protective layer.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Mixtures are very useful. However, sometimes we need to separate mixtures into their components. Remember that the substances in a mixture have not combined chemically. They have not turned into new substances, but are still the same substances as before - they have just been physically combined. That is why we can use physical methods to separate them again.</p>

<p/></div></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-4">Methods of physical separation</h2>
<p/>

<p>Now that we know about the different kinds of mixtures that are possible, we are going to learn about some ways of separating them.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>As an introduction to this you can ask learners about why they think we would want to separate mixtures. For example, imagine that our drinking water comes from a well in the ground and it is muddy. Muddy water is not good to drink. We would want separate the water from the solid material (sand or clay) before using it! Once separated, we would keep the water to drink and throw the sand away. Ask learners if they can think of a way to separate the water from the sand? <em>Learners may suggest filtration (filtering) as a method for separating the sand and water.</em></p>

<p>Learners did an exercise in Chapter 6 of Matter and Materials in Gr. 6 on cleaning muddy water. The chapter entitled 'Processes to purify water' required learners to design, make and evaluate their own filter. You can demonstrate the process again to refresh their memories.

Then, pour a mixture of muddy water into the filter and let the learners observe that clean water passes through the filter, whilst the mud/sand/clay remains behind.</p>

<p>Can you remember the activity from Gr. 6 when Tom used magnetism to separate different kinds of metals at his uncle's junk yard? The <strong>magnetic</strong> properties of the metals allowed them to be separated in this way.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Magnetic separation</h4><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>You could demonstrate how, or let the learners try, to separate a mixture of sand and iron filings by using a magnet. It might help to place the magnet in a small plastic bag so the iron filings are attracted to the magnet, but do not stick to it.</p>

<p/>

<p>The following diagram shows how magnetic separation can be used to separate a mixture of components. In the example, mineral ore that contains two compounds (one magnetic, and the other non-magnetic) is being separated. The ore grains are fed onto a revolving belt. The roller on the end of the belt is magnetic. This means that all the magnetic grains in the ore will stick to the belt when it goes around the roller, while the non-magnetic grains will fall off the end. As soon as the magnetic grains move past the magnetic roller, they will also fall down.</p>

<p>The substances in a solution are mixed on the level of individual particles. In a sugar and water solution, the sugar particles and the water particles are mixed so well that we could not distinguish them with the naked eye. You might think that mixtures that are so 'well-mixed' are impossible to separate! But as we shall soon see, this is not true.</p>

<p/>

<p>In ancient cultures, grain and chaff was separated by a process called winnowing. They would throw the mixture into the air and the wind would blow away the lighter chaff, but not the heavier grain.</p>

<p>Demonstrate this in a lesson by dissolving some salt in water in front of the class at the beginning of the lesson. Make sure they take note of the clear solution. Then pour a little into a shallow aluminium pan, like those used for baking. Place this out in a sunny spot for the duration of the lesson and allow the water to evaporate. The rate of evaporation will depend on how hot and humid it is on the day you do this. At the end of the lesson, collect the pan and show the dried salt that is left behind, just as in a salt pan. You might have to leave it out until the end of the day, depending in how hot it is.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Do you know where most of the salt that we use in South Africa comes from? South Africa gets it salt from inland salt pans, coastal salt pans and seawater. A salt pan is a shallow dam in the ground where salt water <strong>evaporates</strong> to leave a layer of dry salt.</p>

<p>When sea water is allowed to stand in shallow pans, the water gets heated by sunlight and slowly turns into water vapour, through evaporation. Once the water has evaporated completely, the solid salt is left behind.</p>

You could put the ice in a small plastic bag to ensure that the ice does not slip off the plate, but the plate is still cold enough for water vapour to condense. Keeping the ice in a plastic bag will also ensure that the melting ice does not drip into the beaker collecting condensed water. You can also use a beaker or glass of salt solution over a bunsen burner and use a cold piece of glass or mirror to condense the water and collect it in another beaker.</p>

<p>The water that is lost through evaporation can be <strong>condensed</strong> on a cold surface. The cold metal plate will do the job, but it would be difficult to recover all the condensed water, because it will be dripping off the surface of the plate in many different places. Scientists have a solution for that problem: they use a special technique to separate mixtures like these without losing any of the components. The technique is called <strong>distillation</strong>.</p></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Distillation</h4>
<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>If you have the equipment to set up this distillation process, then you can demonstrate it in class. Otherwise there are alternative materials and equipment that you can use. For example, if you do not have a Liebig condenser, you can use a piece of copper pipe. Here are two links which explain how to build your own distillation equipment: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Lab-Quality-Distillation-Apparatus/">http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Lab-Quality-Distillation-Apparatus/</a> and <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://nukegingrich.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/diy-still.pdf">http://nukegingrich.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/diy-still.pdf</a>. Another suggestion is to get learners to also do the research to see how to make their own distillation apparatus, specifically looking at materials which are easy and cheaper to come by. You do not have to have laboratory equipment to demonstrate many science experiments - many can just be 
done by thinking of the materials which you use in everyday life and making a plan! This also makes science more accessible to everyone.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Distillation is the separation of one substance from another by evaporation followed by condensation. The apparatus used in this technique is called a <strong>still</strong>.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0023.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Experimental setup for distillation</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Suppose we want to separate the water and salt in seawater. We would place the seawater in the round flask on the left of the picture (in the distillation flask). We would then boil the seawater to produce water vapour, or steam. The salt would not evaporate with the water, because only the water evaporates. The water vapour rises through the top of the flask and passes into the Liebig condenser.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0024.jpg" width="300" alt="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Liebig\_condensers-two\_2.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">Two Liebig condensers which are used in the distillation process <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Liebig_condensers-two_2.jpg"> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Liebig_condensers-two_2.jpg </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>The Liebig condenser consists of a glass tube within a larger glass tube. The condenser is designed in such a way that cold water can flow through the space between the tubes. This cools the surface of the inner tube. The water vapour condenses against this cold surface and flows into the receiving flask. Since the salt has not evaporated, it stays behind in the distillation flask.</p>

It is described as an eco-distiller that runs on solar power. All you need to do is pour in 5 litres of salty or impure water, tighten the cap, and leave it out in the sun. By the end of a day it can provide bacteria-free, salt-free water that is suitable for drinking.

<p>We can use the same distillation method that we used for separating seawater, to separate the two liquids. The principle is exactly the same, except that we will distill the mixture more than once. Here is how it works:</p>

<p/>

<p>The mixture of the two liquids is placed in the distillation flask and heated to the lowest boiling point. In the case of an ethanol/water mixture, that temperature would be the boiling point of ethanol, namely 78&#176;C. All of the liquid with that boiling point will evaporate, condense in the Liebig condenser, and pass into the receiving flask. The liquid with the higher boiling point will remain in the distillation flask. Suppose it contains a third substance that we want to separate. How would you do this? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>We replace the receiving flask with a clean one and heat the distillation flask again, but this time to the boiling point of the second liquid. The second liquid will evaporate, condense in the cooler and flow into the clean receiving flask, leaving the final component in the mixture in the distillation flask.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The video about distillation of crude oil may be a bit too advanced, but it summarises the process of fractional distillation quite well and mentions relevant, real-world examples of products that are produced. Take note that the video repeatedly mentions 'hydrocarbons'. You can put the learners at ease and tell them it is not important for them to know what this means yet. The periodic table is only dealt with in Chapter 4, but you could help the learners 'decipher' that the crude oil contains a lot of <strong>hydro</strong>gen particles and <strong>carbon</strong> particles put together in different combinations (ratios). Each of the fractions that are eventually collected contain one kind of hydrocarbon combination.</p>

<p>There is one more separation technique for us to explore. Have you noticed how ink on paper will sometimes 'run' when it gets wet?</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0025.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/daquellamanera/4304246279/"/><figcaption class="caption">Can you see how the ink on this sign has run after being wet, probably by the rain? <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/daquellamanera/4304246279/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/daquellamanera/4304246279/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Most inks are a mixture of different pigments, blended to give them just the right colour. A <strong>pigment</strong> is a chemical that gives colour to materials. When a mixture contains colourful compounds, it is often possible to separate the different components using a separating method called chromatography. Let's have a look at this next.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Chromatography</h4><div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Chromatography comes from from the Greek words <em>chroma</em> (meaning 'colour') and <em>graph</em> (meaning 'to write').</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>Chromatography</strong> is a method for separating coloured substances into individual pigments. We are going to explore this in the next investigation.</p>

<h1 class="title">Is black ink really black?</h1>

<p/>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To separate the pigment components in ink using different liquids.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is a fun activity that can be done quickly. If the class is divided into small groups and each group gets a different black marker to experiment with, the chromatograms can be stuck up on the wall afterwards for everyone to see and compare. By looking for matching chromatograms, learners can say which group had the same brand of marker, or which markers are filled with the same ink. If the ink from a certain marker will not separate in one liquid, try using another liquid in the beaker.</p>

<p/>

<p>You could even build a story around the investigation: Stage a murder mystery in which the murderer can be identified by his (or her) black pen. Use three or four black or blue pens of different brands, and produce the unique chromatograms associated with each brand. The inks may look the same when used for writing, but they will behave differently when they are analysed by chromatography.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong></p>

<p>What do you propose the answer to our investigative question is? This is your hypothesis. </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learner-dependent answer. A hypothesis could be 'Black ink is made up of different coloured pigments.'</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>absorbent paper cut into strips approximately 3 cm wide and 12 cm long</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Laboratory Whatman filter paper no. 1 is ideal for chromatography. Alternatively, you can use coffee filters, watercolour paper or strips of paper towel. Even ordinary copy paper works, but more slowly and often this makes the colours separate better. For softer papers you may need longer strips of paper and taller containers, since the liquid is carried up the paper much faster.</p>
</div><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>clear drinking glass or beaker</li>
<li>assorted black pens and markers</li>
<li>tap water</li>
<li>pencil</li>
<li>paper clip or clothes peg</li>
<li>filter paper</li>
<li>dropper</li>
<li>variety of liquid solvents (ammonia, surgical spirits, methylated spirits, and nail polish remover)</li>
</ul><p/>
<div class="note  col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>A <strong>solvent</strong> is a substance that dissolves a <strong>solute</strong>, resulting in a solution. A solvent is usually a liquid, but can also be a solid or a gas.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p><strong>Possible hazards:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Ammonia is a dissolved gas and a weak base. It is not likely to cause burns but ammonia fumes can irritate the mucous membranes of your nose.</li>
<li>Surgical spirits and methanol contain alcohol. Nail polish remover contains acetone. Alcohol and acetone are flammable and should be kept away from heat and flames. You should not inhale the vapours of these solvents.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Safe laboratory practice is extremely important. Take a moment to discuss risks, precautions and safety with learners. Discuss the fact that scientists often need to handle dangerous substances and/or equipment to be able to make observations.</p>

<p/>

<p>When working with ammonia, take care to work in a fume hood or in a well-ventilated space. Leave the door and windows open, so that the fumes do not linger. Similarly, substances containing alcohol should be used in a well-ventilated space, but these are also flammable, so avoid using them in the presence of open flames.</p>

<p/>

<p>It is always advisable to wear latex/nitrile gloves (available from pharmacies) to prevent the absorption of hazardous substances through your skin. Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes from harmful chemicals. Always have clean water nearby to rinse your eyes or wash your hands if chemicals do splash or spill.</p>

<p/>

<p>Careful laboratory practice will not only ensure your own safety, it will also set a good example to learners.</p>

<p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p>

<p/>

<p><strong>To make a strip chromatogram</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Use a black pen or marker to draw a line across one end of the paper strip, 2 cm from the end.</li>
<li>Pour tap water into the beaker to a depth of approximately 1 cm.</li>
<li>Wrap the unmarked end of the paper strip around the pencil and secure it in place with a paper clip.</li>
<li>Before putting it into the glass, adjust the strip of paper so that the height of the inked line is approximately 1 cm above the surface of the liquid by holding it against the outside of the beaker.</li>
<li>Lower the strip into the glass and rest the pencil across the top of the glass as shown in the diagram. The end of the strip should be in the water, but the inked line should be above the surface of the water.</li>
<li>
<p>Allow the liquid to soak up into the paper, rising through the inked line.</p>

	      <figure id="gd-idp4332640"><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0026.png" width="300"/></figure></li>
<li>When the migrating pigments approach the top of the strip, near the paper clip, remove the paper strip and allow it to dry on a flat, non-porous surface.</li>
<li>Make a similar strip chromatogram for each of the black pens you have collected.</li>
<li>Compare the chromatograms. Are they the same or are they different?</li>
<li>When you have finished comparing your chromatogram with those of the rest of the class, you can either stick your chromatogram in the space below, or draw a picture of it in the space.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>You can also use a clothes peg to hold the strip in place while drying.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>To make a circular chromatogram</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Lay a large round piece of filter paper on a smooth non-absorbent surface, like the surface of your desk, for instance.</li>
<li>Use one of the coloured pens to make a 0.5 to 1 cm ink spot in the centre of the disk.</li>
<li>Lay the paper disk flat over the top of a beaker.</li>
<li>Place a drop of water in the centre of the ink spot.</li>
<li>
<p>Add another drop of water every minute or so to make the chromatogram spread toward the edges of the paper disk.</p>
 
	      <figure id="gd-idp1692944"><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0027.png" width="300"/></figure></li>

<p>What can you conclude about the pigments that make up black ink? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learners should note that black ink is actually made up of a number of different coloured pigments.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>A closer look at how this works:</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>In paper chromatography, liquid is drawn through the paper fibers. But, why do the pigments in the ink separate into bands of different colours?</p>

<p/>

<p>The pigments in the ink are carried along by the liquid, but because they are different compounds, they get carried upward at different speeds. This causes them to appear as bands of different colours on the chromatogram.</p>

<p/>

<p>Look at the picture of the chromatogram below.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr7mm02-gd-0028.jpg" width="300" alt="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TLC\_black\_ink.jpg"/><figcaption class="caption">An example of a strip chromatogram <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TLC_black_ink.jpg"> http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:TLC_black_ink.jpg </a></figcaption></figure><p/>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Which colour pigment is moving up the paper at the fastest speed? Why do you say so? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The yellow pigment is moving the fastest because it has travelled the longest distance.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Which colour pigment is moving up the paper at the slowest speed? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The green pigment is moving the slowest because it has travelled the shortest distance.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>

<p>Why are the different pigments carried at different speeds?</p>

<p/>

<p>Pigments migrate at different speeds because of differences in their properties: large pigment particles tend to move more slowly. Furthermore, particles that dissolve well in the liquid will tend to stay in the liquid and be carried to the top quickly, while particles that bind well to the paper will tend to move more slowly.</p>

<p>Now that we have learnt about some of the different ways in which mixtures can be separated, we are going to apply what we know to separate a mixture made of many components.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Separating a complex mixture</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Some schools also use combo plates for the various practical tasks in Matter and Materials. This is encouraged and the activities in these workbooks can be adjusted slightly to work with whichever equipment and apparatus you have available to you in your school.</p>

<p/>

<p>Also, if learners find the flow chart too complex at this stage, you can alternatively get them to write out the steps they would follow to separate all the materials in the mixture and why they have chosen each method of separation.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Imagine you are a member of a team of scientists working together in a laboratory. Your team has been given an important job. You have been given a beaker that contains a mixture of substances to separate.</p>

<p/>

<p>The mixture contains the following components:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>sand</li>
<li>iron filings</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>ethanol</li>
<li>water</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Your job is to design a procedure for separating the mixture into its individual components. How would you do that? Your procedure should be summarised in the form of a flow chart.</p>

<p/>

<p>Before you start, imagine what the mixture would look like. Draw a picture of the a clear container and the different contents in the mixture in the space. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This may be a difficult task for the learners to accomplish, but it is very important for the learners to be able to visualise the mixture before they start to plan the experiment. If they do not, the ideas will remain abstract and the learners may have difficulty sequencing the different separation steps correctly. You could guide them by asking the following questions. Alternately, you could prepare the mixture for them to look at it before drawing it:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>What does the container look like? Draw it on your page.</li>
<li>Which liquids are in the container? (Ethanol and water). Now draw the container with a mixture of ethanol and water in it. Would you be able to see the ethanol AND the water when they are mixed? (No, they would just look like liquid in the container.)</li>
<li>Now add the sand. Would it mix with the water or sink to the bottom? (Most of it would sink to the bottom.)</li>
<li>Now add the iron filings. Would it mix with the water or sink to the bottom? (It would sink to the bottom.)</li>
<li>Now add the salt. Would the salt sink to the bottom or dissolve in the water? (It would dissolve in the water.) Would we be able to see it if it was dissolved in the water? (No.)</li>
</ul><p/>
</div>

<p><strong>Invite a chemist/scientist:</strong> Do you know someone who is a chemist or a chemical engineer? Perhaps you live near a university? If you do, you could invite a chemist to come to your school and talk to your class about the work that chemists do. Alternatively, you could visit the chemist at their workplace and ask them to show you around. You can get learners to prepare a few questions beforehand; for instance, you could ask them about their work, their training and what they think are the qualities needed if one wanted to become a chemist. Just remember to make an appointment first!</p>

<p/>

<p>This activity could be turned into a small group project and learners could be required to write a short report on the information they have gathered.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Do you know what chemists do? Let's discover the possibilities of chemistry!</p>

<p/>

<p>Chemists study various chemical elements and compounds, their properties and how they react with each other. We will learn about elements and compounds in the next chapter. Chemists are also responsible for developing new materials with specific properties; such as new medicines; innovative materials for building buildings and other structures; materials that could be used for making fuels from renewable sources and many others.</p>

<p/>

<p>If you study chemistry after you have finished school, you can work as a researcher, a laboratory technician, a science teacher and many other important and stimulating jobs! Be curious and discover the possibilities! Science can help us solve problems in the world around us.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Careers research task</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is not for assessment purposes and is aimed at getting learners to start thinking about the possibilities for their futures. The emphasis should be on discovering the possibilities that science, technology maths and engineering give us, not just work opportunities, but using them to solve problems in the world.</p>

<div class="note  col-md-10" data-type="keyconcepts"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>A mixture consists of two or more components that have different physical properties.</li>
<li>The components in a mixture are not chemically joined; they do not change their chemical identities and they retain their physical properties as well.</li>
<li>When we want to separate a mixture, we can use the differences in the physical properties of the components of the mixture to separate the components from each other.</li>
<li>Hand sorting is a suitable separation method for a mixture that contains a relatively small number of large items.</li>
<li>Sieving is a suitable separation method when the pieces to be separated are sized differently.</li>
<li>Filtration is a good method for separating an undissolved solid from a liquid.</li>
<li>Components with different magnetic properties can be separated using magnetic separation.</li>
<li>Evaporation is a suitable separation method for removing a liquid from a solid.</li>
<li>Distillation is a suitable method for separating two liquids with different boiling points.</li>
<li>Chromatography is a good method for separating coloured pigments from each other.</li>
<li>Waste disposal should be managed in a responsible way so that the negative impact on the environment is as small as possible.</li>
<li>Metals, plastics, paper and glass can be recycled.</li>
<li>Organic waste can be turned into compost.</li>
<li>Responsible waste disposal is everyone's responsibility, but it is usually managed by the local authorities, who have systems for sorting and recycling waste.</li>
<li>Poor waste management leads to negative consequences for humans, animals and the environment. Some of these are:
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>pollution of the soil, water resources and the environment;</li>
<li>health hazards and the spread of disease;</li>
<li>blockage of sewers and drainage systems;</li>
<li>land wasted when it is used to dump or bury garbage (landfills); and</li>
<li>materials and other resources wasted when they could have been recycled.</li>
</ul></li>

<p>A vacuum cleaner creates a suspension of dust in air as it sucks up the dust on the floor. Clean air comes out of the vacuum cleaner. How does the vacuum cleaner separate the dust from the air? [2 marks] </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The vacuum cleaner has a fine filter in it which traps the dust particles. The clean air is able to get through the filter, but the dust is left behind. Some more modern vacuum cleaners also filter the air through water which cleans the air even further. Some very fine dust particles may be able to get through the fine filter, but if the air is passed through water, then even very fine particles are trapped.</p>
