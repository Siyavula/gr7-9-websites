<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>(3 weeks)</p>

<p>The ordering of the chapter in Gr 8 Planet Earth and Beyond in CAPS is as follows:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>The solar system</li>
<li>Beyond the solar system</li>
<li>Looking into space</li>
</ol><p>Although this is the order in CAPS and it is the way in which the content has been ordered here in these workbooks, we suggest starting with Chapter 3 on 'Looking into space' first, and then going on to the other two chapters. This makes more sense conceptually to first learn about how we see into space, and then go on to look at the objects that have been observed in our solar system and beyond, making use of a variety of telescopes.</p>

<p>In Grade 6 learners covered material regarding the solar system, and in Grade 7, they focused on the Sun, Earth, Moon system. Learners should be familiar with the fact that the Sun is a star located at the centre of the solar system and they should understand that the planets orbit around the Sun. They should also be aware that there are two types of planets: smaller rocky planets and larger gas giants. In this chapter, the solar system is introduced in more detail, and the physical explanation for the two types of planets is summarised. They will compare the properties of the different planets, information that they will then use to explain why the Earth is presently the only planet suitable for life in our solar system. The main aims of this chapter are to ensure that learners understand the following:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The Sun is a star and produces heat and light (energy) via nuclear reactions.</li>
<li>The planets, dwarf planets and asteroids all orbit around the Sun, held in their orbits by the force of gravity.</li>
<li>Different planets have different observed properties and characteristics.</li>
<li>The Earth is located in a special zone around the Sun, where life is possible.</li>
</ul><p>Section 1.1 covers the properties of the Sun, section 1.2 introduces all the other objects in the solar system and section 1.3 covers our special place in the solar system.</p>

<p>In this section students learn how the Sun produces its energy in its core and how this energy is transported to the surface and then into space. The effect that the Sun has on the Earth is also briefly mentioned. This section focuses on conducting observations of the Sun and looking at images of the Sun to study the surface features, including sunspots.</p>

<p>There are two activities in this section which involve observations of the Sun. It is very important that learners DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN, even with sunglasses on, as they may permanently damage their eyes.</p>

<p>Before we look at the Sun close up, let's summarise what you learned about the Sun in Grades 6 and 7:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>The Sun is our closest star and is very important for life on Earth as it provides us with light and heat.</li>
<li>The Sun is located at the very centre of our solar system.</li>
<li>The Earth and other planets all orbit around the Sun, held in orbit by the force of gravity.</li>

</div>
<p>What do you think the Sun would look like if it was further away, like the other stars we see at night?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Although the Sun is the brightest object in our sky, this is only because it is so close to us. The Sun is actually a medium sized star of average brightness compared with other stars. If the sun were farther away, it would look like a small point of light like the other stars in the sky.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Let's look at the Sun in more detail.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb01-gd-0002.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An image of the Sun taken with the SOHO space satellite.</figcaption></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="visit">

<p>How the Sun works.<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gS1dpowPlE8"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>Do you know what the Sun is made of? The Sun is mostly made up of hydrogen gas (about 71%), and also helium gas (about 27%) with a tiny amount of other gases. The temperature at the Sun's surface is very high, around 5500 &#176;C. However, that is nothing compared to deep inside the Sun. At the Sun's centre, or core, it is about 15 million &#176;C. It is so hot at the Sun's centre that <strong>nuclear reactions</strong> can occur, which change atoms from one element to another. In the Sun's case, four hydrogen nuclei are squeezed or fused together to form a new helium nucleus. This process is called <strong>nuclear fusion</strong>.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>At the temperatures encountered at the centre of the Sun the atoms are ionized and so nuclear fusion involves the merging of atomic nuclei rather than atoms.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Revise the model of the atom that you learned about in Matter and Materials if you are unsure of some of the terms used here, such as nucleus, which is at the centre of an atom, and consists of protons and neutrons.</p>
</div>
<p>This nuclear fusion reaction releases energy because the new helium nuclei produced have very slightly less mass than the four hydrogen nuclei used to make them. How can this be? Well, according to the famous scientist Albert Einstein, energy and mass are equivalent. Some of the mass in the hydrogen nuclei is converted and released as energy when the nuclei fuse to make helium. A very large amount of energy is released. This energy travels outwards from the Sun's core towards its surface. The energy eventually reaches the Sun's surface somewhere between 17,000 and 100,000 years later! The Sun's energy then spreads out into the solar system in the form of heat and light.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Albert Einstein explained the mass-energy equivalence with the famous equation E = mc<sup>2</sup>.</p>

</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Different studies of the transport of photons within the Sun estimate different travel times to reach the surface. Much older studies reported times of order of millions of years, but these have now all been revised downwards to either tens or hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

<p>Although we often say that the Sun "burns" its hydrogen fuel into helium, the Sun does not burn in the same way that a fire does, because it is not on fire. The energy generated from the Sun comes from fusing atomic nuclei together to form a new atomic nucleus. As a result of the extreme temperatures throughout the Sun, its gas glows, giving off light. Our usual experience of burning (or fire) is actually a chemical reaction where atoms combine to form molecules, e.g. when oxygen combines with carbon to form carbon dioxide.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The word fuse means to join together, so nuclear fusion reactions occur when lighter atoms join together into heavier atoms.</p>
</div>
<p>You are now going to observe the Sun to look at its surface features. <strong>Remember, you should never look directly at the Sun as it can permanently damage your eyes</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em> You can use either a telescope with a filter on it or a pinhole to project an image of the Sun onto a screen to safely view the Sun's image.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Observing the Sun using a telescope</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is an outdoors activity. You will need a telescope or binoculars for this activity. <strong>An alternative activity is included after this,which does not need a telescope or binoculars.</strong>You will be projecting an image of the Sun onto a white card or screen for your learners to observe.</p>

<p>If you do not have access to a telescope or binoculars it could be worth contacting a local amateur astronomy club as they are often keen to get involved in educational activities. <em>It is vital that learners do not look directly at the Sun, with or without sunglasses.</em> The projection method used in this activity is safe and also has the bonus that any sunspots on the Sun's surface can also be seen. Sunspots are regions of slightly lower temperature on the Sun's surface, and therefore appear darker. If you do not have access to a telescope, but do have internet access, then an image of the Sun is posted daily at <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime-images.html"> http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/realtime-images.html</a></p>

<p>It is assumed that this will be a teacher-led demonstration, however, there is no reason why learners cannot contribute by building the shade collar and setting up the white card. If you are using binoculars instead of a telescope, be sure to cover one of the lenses so that only one side of the binoculars is used. When trying to point the telescope at the Sun, a useful trick is to watch the shadow of the telescope tube: if pointed directly toward the Sun, then the sides of the tube will cast no shadows. Preparing for the activity can sometimes take a bit of fiddling, so it is a good idea for you to set your learners a short task to do while you set up if you have not had the opportunity to set up ahead of time.</p>

<p>Sunspots are sometimes (not always) visible on the Sun's surface. You are more likely to see sunspots when the Sun is most active during solar maximum. The Sun's activity varies over an 11 year cycle. Solar maximum is currently predicted to be in 2013. Solar minimum is currently predicted to be in 2019. As an extension you could repeat this activity over the course of several days to see if any sunspots or sunspot groups change shape, size, or position over time.</p>

<p>NEVER look directly at the Sun, even with sunglasses on as you can permanently damage your eyes.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Take a piece of cardboard and place it up against the narrowest end of the telescope.</li>
<li>Draw an outline around the edge of the telescope on the card to use as a guide for cutting to make the collar.</li>
<li>Cut out inside the circle you just drew so that the cardboard can fit over the telescope as shown in the figure above. You can cut a single slit into the circle from the edge of the card as shown in the diagram</li>
<li>Place the collar on the telescope. Adjust the size of the cut out circle if necessary (for example if your telescope is slightly wider in the middle than at the end, you may want to make your circle slightly larger). This collar shades the area, where the image will fall, from stray light.</li>
<li>Select the lowest magnification eyepiece lens you have and insert it into the telescope's eyepiece.</li>
<li>Focus the telescope by looking at a distant object (NOT the Sun).</li>
<li>Point the telescope at the Sun (do NOT look through the telescope to do this).</li>
<li>Place a chair behind the telescope and rest a white piece of card on it. The card should be tilted towards the telescope.</li>
<li>Adjust the direction in which the telescope is pointing until the image of the Sun appears on the white paper card. This may take some time.</li>
<li>Keeping the telescope still, move the white card toward or away from the eyepiece until the image of the Sun fits neatly in the middle of the card. Adjust the chair's position as needed.</li>
<li>Adjust the tilt of the white card until the Sun's image is circular.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Ask the learners to point out any interesting features they notice about the image. There may be sunspots (dark spots) visible. Also you should see that the image is brighter in the middle of the Sun's disc than at the edges. This is because when we look at the middle of the Sun's disc we can see deeper into the Sun than when we look towards the edge. The temperature of the Sun increases with increasing depth. At the centre of the Sun's disc we are seeing a hotter region. As the intensity of light is proportional to the temperature, the Sun looks brighter in the centre.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you do not have access to a telescope or binoculars, you can perform the following activity to view the Sun.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Observing the Sun with a pinhole camera</h1>
<p/>

<p>In this activity you will reflect an image of the Sun onto a white card or screen for your learners to observe. This method has the advantage of not needing a telescope or binoculars, however, the solar image produced will be a bit fuzzy. However, it should be good enough to show large sunspots. This activity is designed as a teacher-led demonstration. If you have a sunlit window or door to your class you can do this activity in the classroom. If you do not have a classroom with a sunlit window, or if your class is very small, you can do the activity outdoors, reflecting the Sun's image onto a shaded wall or back into a darkened classroom.</p>

<p>As a rough guide, begin with a distance of around 8 m between the white card and the mirror. The further away you place the mirror from the white screen the fainter and larger the image will appear. At closer distances the image will be brighter but it may not be in very good focus.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous activity, sunspots are sometimes (not always) visible on the Sun's surface. Therefore, you could repeat this activity over the course of several days to see if any sunspots or sunspot groups change shape, size, or position over time.</p>

<p/>

<p>This is an <strong>additional, extension</strong> activity. In this activity learners will look at images taken over three consecutive days in 2013. The images were taken using the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory space satellite. In the images two major sunspot groups are visible, one in the Sun's northern hemisphere and one in the Sun's southern hemisphere. Learners should identify the two groups and observe that they move across the Sun from left to right in each successive image. The sunspots move like this because the Sun is rotating on its axis.</p>

<p>You could begin this activity by asking learners if they noticed any features on the Sun's surface when they observed it in class, before asking them to look at the pictures below.</p>

<p>The Sun's surface often has little blemishes on it. These dark spots on the Sun are called sunspots. They are areas that are slightly cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface. The Sun's surface is typically about 5500 &#176;C and a typical sunspot has a temperature about 3900 &#176;C.</p>

<p>As the Sun is made up of gas, there is no solid surface like on Earth. So when one says that you are looking at the Sun's surface what are you actually looking at? Imagine that you are standing in thick fog (mist) with a friend. You can see things close to you, like your hand in front of you and your friend standing next to you. However, because the fog is so thick you cannot see far into the distance. Similarly, when we look at the Sun, we cannot see right into the centre of the Sun. As you go deeper and deeper in towards the centre of the Sun the gas begins to get thicker and thicker so that we cannot see through it. The deepest depth that we can see into the Sun's gas is what we call the Sun's surface.</p>

<p>Sunspots are areas that are slightly cooler, and therefore darker, than the rest of the Sun's surface. A typical sunspot only lasts a few days. When a sunspot lasts for several days you can observe it move across the Sun's disc. The sunspot appears to move across the Sun because the Sun is spinning slowly on its own axis.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The number of sunspots on the Sun increases and decreases in a regular pattern which repeats every 11 years. When there are more sunspots the Sun is more active and there are more solar storms and more of the Sun's energy reaches the Earth.</p>
</div>
<p>The outer atmosphere of the Sun is called the <strong>corona</strong>. Gas particles from the corona are constantly escaping into space, forming the <strong>solar wind</strong>. When the Sun is very active, violent eruptions called solar flares occur on its surface.</p>

<p/>

<p>This section covers all the objects in orbit around the Sun including the eight planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud and comets. Learners should be familiar with the eight planets in the solar system, which were covered in Gr 6, however it is very likely that they are unfamiliar with the remaining components of the solar system. The first half of this section is intended as revision, to remind learners about the properties of the eight planets. The two types of planets, the terrestrial (rocky) planets and gas giants are compared and contrasted in detail. The second half of this section covers the smaller bodies in the solar system such as dwarf planets, comets and asteroids. It should be stressed to learners that new discoveries are made all the time and so the numbers of moons discovered around planets and the number of dwarf planets in the solar system will change over time.</p>

<p>The Sun is by far the largest and most massive object in our solar system making up 98\% of the total mass of the solar system. Due to the Sun's massive size, its large gravitational pull causes the planets and other objects in the solar system to orbit around it.</p>

<p>In orbit around the Sun are the eight planets along with their moons, dwarf planets and many much smaller objects like asteroids, Kuiper belt objects and comets. You will learn all about these objects later on in this chapter.</p>

<p>The four planets closest to the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. These are called <strong>terrestrial planets</strong> because they have solid rocky surfaces. Further out, lie the <strong>gas giants</strong> Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These are much larger than the terrestrial planets and are mainly made of gas with small cores of rocky materials. In between the terrestrial planets and the gas giants lies the asteroid belt and out beyond the orbit of Neptune lies the Kuiper belt.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are lots of different types of objects orbiting the Sun, and not all of them are planets! To be classed as a planet, an object must:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>orbit around the Sun</li>
<li>be large enough that its own gravity pulls it into a spherical shape</li>
<li>clear out smaller objects in its orbit, by either flinging them into another orbit or by attracting and then sticking them to itself (this means that there are no other similar sized objects orbiting in their vicinity)</li>
</ol><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Pluto was reclassified from planet to dwarf planet in 2006. Although Pluto orbits the Sun and is almost round, it has not cleared out other objects in its orbit, and so it cannot be classified as a planet. There are many more dwarf planets at similar distances from the Sun as Pluto.</p>

<p>In this activity learners will get a sense of the scale of the solar system. Using a model where the Sun is scaled to the size of a grapefruit, the other planets are also scaled down and are placed in orbit around the grapefruit Sun at the correctly scaled distance. This activity needs a lot of space. The distance you need from the Sun to Neptune is 321 m. The scaling used in this activity is 14 billion to one. You can change the scaling to suit the space you have available.</p>

<p>A summary table is included here with the scaled sizes and distances for the planets for your reference. Learners can use a measuring tape to measure out the distances. If no measuring tape is available then the approximate distance in strides is also given.</p>

<p>Now that you have an idea of the size and scale of the planets in our solar system, let's compare the two groups of planets, the inner worlds, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars with outer worlds, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, in more detail. Look at the following pictures which compare the features of the two groups of planets.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The aim of this section is to remind learners about the two types of planets. They were introduced to the two planetary types, the inner rocky terrestrial planets and the outer gas giants in Grade 6. This section covers this information again and goes on to explain why there are two types of planets. For a summary of each planet's properties see <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/"> http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/</a></p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The gas giants are much larger than the terrestrial planets.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Let's now look at the compositions of the two types of planets.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp1043472"><img src="images/gr8eb01-gd-0014.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p>The above image shows the internal structure of the terrestrial planets. They all have a metal core, a rocky mantle and a thin outer crust. They also have a thin atmosphere (Mercury has an extremely thin atmosphere). The Earth's atmosphere is unique in the solar system in that it contains abundant oxygen, which is necessary to sustain life on Earth.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>When it is winter on Mars you can see polar ice caps forming on the planet, like on Earth. However, unlike the Earth's polar ice caps which are made of frozen water, the ice caps on Mars are made of frozen carbon dioxide. This frozen carbon dioxide comes from Mars' atmosphere.</p>
</div>
<p>The image below shows the structure of the gas giants. They are mostly made of hydrogen and helium gases and are much less dense than the rocky terrestrial planets.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp3286976"><img src="images/gr8eb01-gd-0015.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p>As you go deeper into the atmospheres of Saturn and Jupiter their atmospheres get denser and denser until they gradually become a liquid. This liquid hydrogen is called metallic hydrogen. Deeper down they have a solid core made of rocky materials.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Hydrogen is a liquid deep inside Jupiter and Saturn because the hydrogen molecules have been squeezed together due to the enormous pressure at those depths caused by the weight of the planet's atmosphere above.</p>
</div>
<p>Uranus and Neptune have thick atmospheres which have methane in addition to hydrogen and helium. The methane gives them their blue colour. Scientists think that below their atmospheres they have a slushy mantle made of water, ammonia and methane ices. At their centres they have a rocky-icy core.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Ice does not just refer to water ice, but other frozen elements and compounds too. Also, the rocky-ice materials do not resemble any rock or ice you would see on Earth, since the temperatures and pressures on these planets and gas giants are much, much higher.</p>
</div>
<p>Look at the pictures below. They show images of the gas giants. What features do you see that the gas giants all have in common?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>They all have rings.</p>

</div>
<p>You can see that <em>all</em> the gas giants have rings. None of the terrestrial planets have rings.</p>

<p>Another difference between the inner rocky and outer gas giant planets, are the number of moons orbiting each planet. Look at the table below which shows the number of moons each planet in our solar system has.</p>

</div>
<p>What can you say in general about the number of moons that the two types of planet have?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The terrestrial planets have no or few moons whereas the gas giants have lots of moons.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The terrestrial planets are much closer to the Sun than the gas giants. Because of this, the terrestrial planets orbit the Sun in less time than the gas giants, because they have a shorter distance to cover.</p>

<p>Why do you think the two types of planets are so different?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learner-dependent answer. Answer in text below.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>When the solar system was forming, the difference in temperature across the early solar system caused the inner planets to be rocky and the outer ones to be gaseous. Close to the Sun it was hot and only materials with very high melting points, such as metals, could remain solid and form planets. Further away from the Sun, where it was cold, compounds like water and methane were frozen. Astronomers call these frozen compounds <em>ices</em>. Therefore the cores of the gas giants contain rocky and icy compounds. As the abundance of metals in the universe is very small, the inner planets are much smaller than the gas giants. The gas giants could also attract large amounts of hydrogen and helium to their atmospheres due to their size.</p>

<p>Let's continue to compare the rocky planets and the gas giants.</p>

<p>The day length given here is the average time in hours for the Sun to move from the noon position in the sky at a point on the equator back to the same position. This is not the same as the time for the planet to complete one revolution on its axis with respect to the stars. For example the Earth completes one revolution on its axis with respect to the stars in 23.9 hours, however, because the Earth moves along in its orbit as it rotates, it actually takes 24 hours for the Sun to return to the same position in the sky again (which is how we conventionally define a day on Earth - from noon to noon).</p>

Although there is no liquid water on the planet's surface now, scientists think that there may still be some water in cracks and tiny holes in underground rock.</p>

                    
<p>Mars has been visited many times by robotic landers. The first lander, NASA's Viking 1, landed on Mars in 1976, a long time before you were born! It took the first close-up pictures of the Martian surface but found no evidence of life. Water ice has been discovered below the planet's surface, and minerals indicating that liquid water was once present have also been found by Mars landers. The latest lander currently exploring Mars is NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission, with its rover named Curiosity. Curiosity landed on Mars in August 2012 and is busy investigating the planet's rocks near a giant crater called the Gale crater. One of the main aims of the Mars Science Laboratory is to determine whether Mars ever had an environment capable of supporting life.</p>

<p>Asteroids are small rocky objects that are believed to be left over from the formation of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago. They range in size from tens of metres across to several hundred kilometres across and come in a variety of shapes. Most asteroids are found in the <strong>asteroid belt</strong>, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. More than 100,000 asteroids lie in the asteroid belt and several thousand of the largest ones have been named.</p>

<p/>

<p>In this activity learners will investigate how craters are formed by dropping balls into a tray of sand. Although you can do this activity with flour, it works best with sand. There are two parts to this experiment. In the first part learners will investigate how the mass of an object affects the crater size formed. In the second part, learners will investigate how the height at which an object is dropped affects the size of the crater it leaves. You can use more objects in the investigation if you have time, and as an extension you can examine the effect of impact angle on the shape of the crater formed.</p>

<p>You will need to experiment beforehand with the type of sand that you are using. Before your class performs this investigation, drop marbles into the sand that you have, to observe what kinds of craters the marbles leave. Experiment with the best possible option, for example, you might need to add some moisture to the sand so that you are able to see the craters.</p>

<p>What does this investigation tell us about craters on the surfaces of planets?</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>It tells us that craters on the surfaces of other planets are formed due to impacts. The impacting objects must have been travelling very fast or have been very massive, because the craters we observe on other planets are much larger than the craters made in this experiment.</p>

<p>A comet will remain in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud unless it is disturbed by another comet. If this happens, then the comet's orbit changes and occasionally the comet will come into the inner solar system for us to see.</p>

Some comet dust tails can be millions of kilometres long. The dust tail usually points back along the path of the comet.</p>

<p>Comets often have a second tail called an ion tail. The ion tail is made of ions that are pushed away from the comet's head by particles emitted from the Sun's atmosphere, called the solar wind. Let's find out more about this type of tail.</p>

They will consider the conditions thought necessary for life and compare those with the conditions found on Earth and on Earth's neighbours. A nice way to introduce this topic is to have a class discussion about whether learners think aliens exist on other planets and, if so, what they might be like.

</div>
<p>The average temperature on Earth is a moderate 15 &#176;C. Because of this, water can exist in liquid form on Earth. <em>This is important because scientists think that liquid water is one of the key things needed for life.</em> Venus has an average temperature of 464 &#176;C and no liquid water exists on Venus because it is too hot. On Mars, the opposite is true. The average temperature on Mars is -63 &#176;C and any water on Mars would be frozen. Earth is unique in our solar system as it is the only planet known to have liquid water on its surface and to harbour life.</p>

<p>If the Earth were too close to the Sun it would be too hot and all the water would evaporate from the oceans, like it has on Venus. If the Earth were too far from the Sun it would be too cold, and all the water would be frozen, like on Mars. Earth is at just the right distance from the Sun to have liquid water on its surface. The other planets in the solar system are either too close or too far from the Sun. The range of distances that a planet can lie from the Sun and still have liquid water on the planet's surface is called the <strong>habitable zone</strong><em>.</em> Estimates for the habitable zone in our solar system range from 0.8 - 1.4 astronomical units (AU).</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>An astronomical unit corresponds to the average distance between the Earth and the Sun.</p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>You will probably find different quoted ranges for the habitable zone from different sources. This is because different scientists have used slightly different criteria to define what "habitable" means. Many studies focus on how life on Earth would be affected if the Earth were closer to or farther from the Sun. However, the point at which life can no longer exist on Earth is uncertain.</p>

<p>Learner-dependent answer. This is also an ideal opportunity for a class discussion. Answers could include, sunlight for energy, oxygen, carbon (we are carbon based), liquid water. Note that other life forms might not be carbon based and that life comes in many forms like bacteria, animals and plants. Scientists are looking for more than just human-like beings and other forms of life that we find on Earth. Also, we are likely to be biased in what we think the conditions are that are needed for life, because we only know about life on Earth.</p>

<p>Scientists think that in order for life to arise and survive on a planet:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>there must be sunlight for plants to grow.</li>

<p>Which of the planets in the solar system have moderate temperatures and liquid water on their surface?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

<p/>
</div>
<p>As you can see the Earth is very fortunate, because it lies at just the right distance from the Sun to have moderate temperatures and abundant liquid water. The Sun provides the energy for plants to grow. There is plenty of oxygen in Earth's present day atmosphere and oceans, which means that life can survive on land and in the Earth's oceans. The Earth is unique in that it is the only planet we know of that has life.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The moons Europa (orbiting Jupiter) and Titan (orbiting Saturn) are considered to be places where life may exist. Europa's surface is covered in smooth water ice and scientists think that there might be a water ocean beneath the icy surface. Titan has liquid lakes and seas on its surface, although they are not made of water, but rather liquid methane and ethane. Some scientists think that life may be able to survive in these lakes.</p>
</div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-17">The greenhouse effect</h3><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>You may have heard a lot about global warming and the greenhouse effect in the news and in our studies in Energy and Change.</p>
</div>
<p>During the day, the Sun shines through the atmosphere heating the Earth's surface. At night, the Earth's surface cools, releasing the heat back into space. Some of the heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the air like carbon dioxide, which causes the Earth to remain warmer than it would have otherwise. This is called the <strong>greenhouse effect</strong>.</p>

<p>Scientists think that due to human activities, like cutting down forests and burning fossil fuels, the greenhouse effect is now too strong. Scientists are more than 90 % certain that the increase in greenhouse gases has caused the average temperature on Earth to rise. This is known as global warming.</p>

<p>Average temperatures on Earth have increased by 0.8&#176;C around the world since 1880, with the biggest increase in the last few decades. The rate of warming is also increasing.</p>
</div>
<p>Venus provides us with a clue as to what might happen to the Earth if global warming continues. Venus' thick atmosphere has led to a runaway greenhouse effect on the planet, heating it to 462 &#176;C. Venus's oceans have boiled away leaving behind a hot, inhospitable planet. We should therefore try our best to look after our precious planet!</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-18">The beginnings of life</h3>
<p>Scientists do not know how life began on Earth, but they estimate that the early ancestor of modern bacteria was alive on Earth 3.5 billion years ago. The early Earth's atmosphere had almost no oxygen. Instead, it was composed mainly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapour with some methane and ammonia. Carbon dioxide and water vapour were pumped into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions, which caused the atmosphere to change over time. Eventually the water vapour in the atmosphere condensed to form rain, forming the first oceans. Eventually living organisms (bacteria) appeared in the oceans. These simple organisms used sunlight, water and carbon dioxide in the oceans to produce sugars and oxygen. What is this process called?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This process is called photosynthesis.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>This is where the first oxygen in the ocean and atmosphere came from. That oxygen made it possible for other organisms to develop and flourish and is the reason that you are here today.</p>
