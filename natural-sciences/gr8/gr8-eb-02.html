<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>3 weeks</p>

<p>Thus far, the learners have only been exposed to solar system astronomy. In this chapter learners will now be introduced to astronomy outside the solar system, which focuses on the studies of galaxies and the Universe.</p>

<p>The main aims of this chapter are to ensure that learners understand the following:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The Sun is our closest star, but if it were farther away it would appear just like all the other stars in the sky at night.</li>
<li>Stars are arranged in galaxies, held together by the force of gravity.</li>
<li>Our own galaxy is called the Milky Way Galaxy.</li>
<li>There are billions of other galaxies in the Universe and they come in a variety of shapes and sizes.</li>
<li>The distances between stars and galaxies are enormous and so new units of measurement are needed because familiar units like kilometres are too small to be useful.</li>
<li>On the largest scale, matter in the Universe is arranged rather like a bath sponge, into thin filamentary structures with large voids between them.</li>
</ul><p>If you have internet access and a projector in your class, an interesting and fun way to introduce what lies beyond our solar system, and beyond the Milky Way, is to use this interactive animation 'Scale of the Universe', where you use a sliding scale to either zoom in or zoom out, available here: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1iaQkZV">bit.ly/1iaQkZV</a>. Start with the human sized scale and zoom out. For interest, you can also go back to the start and zoom in to get to the microscopic level and even smaller for learners to appreciate the size of atoms.</p>

<p/>

<p>In this section learners will discover that the Sun is one of about 200 billion stars in our home galaxy, the Milky Way. Learners will be introduced to the main features of the Milky Way Galaxy which include its central bulge, flat disk and spiral arms. Students will also learn the Sun's place within the Milky Way: we are not in the centre of our galaxy, but rather are out on the edge of our galaxy, about halfway out from the centre.</p>

<p>Some learners have difficulty in envisioning what they are actually looking at when they see the Milky Way in the sky at night. In fact, every individual star that we see in the sky at night is part of our Milky Way. If the Milky Way were spherical in shape, then we would not see the thin band of the Milky Way across the sky, stars would be more uniformly distributed across the whole sky. However, because the Milky Way is flat, when you look at the band of the Milky Way across the sky at night you are actually looking along the plane of the disk of the galaxy in towards the centre where there is a high density of stars. The density of stars is so high that they cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye, and so the Milky Way appears as a white band of light across the sky.</p>

<p/>

<li>spiral arm</li>
</ul></div>
<p>At the darkest places on Earth, far away from city lights, you can see thousands of stars at night using nothing but your eyes. In fact there are many more stars in the sky which are too faint for us to see.</p>

<p>All of the individual stars that you can see are members of our <strong>Milky Way Galaxy</strong>. A galaxy is a massive collection of stars, gas and dust all held together by gravity. The Milky Way has about 200 billion stars and our Sun is just one of those stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>

<p>From the Earth, the Milky Way looks like a bright hazy band of light across the sky, mixed in with dark dusty patches. This was called <em>Galaxies Kuklos</em> by the Greeks which means the <em>Milky Circle</em> because they thought it looked like milk spilled across the sky<em>.</em> The Romans changed the name to <em>Via Lactea</em> which means the <em>Milky Road</em> or the <em>Milky Way.</em></p>

</div>
<p>The image shows what scientists think our galaxy looks like. You can see the spiral arms of our Milky Way. These are bluish in colour and are filled with dust and gas and hot young stars. The thin dark wisps in the image are dust lanes, regions where the gas is very dusty. The central part of the galaxy is more orangey in colour than the spiral arms. This is because the stars found at the centre of the galaxy tend to be older and cooler than the young hot blue stars.</p>

<p>Scientists think that there are five major spiral arms in our galaxy. These are the Norma Arm, the Scutum-Crux Arm, the Sagittarius Arm, the Perseus Arm and the Cygnus Arm.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Some of the arms have alternative names, a table is included here for reference in case other names are listed in books or online.</p>

</div>
<p>Our Sun is located in a small spiral arm called the Orion (or Local) Arm which lies between the Sagittarius Arm and the Perseus Arm. Our Sun is about halfway out from the centre of the galaxy.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Our Solar System is orbiting around the centre of the Milky Way at thousands of kilometres per hour. But even at that speed, it still takes over 200 million years for us to make one complete orbit around the Milky Way Galaxy.</p>
</div>
<p>All the stars in this galaxy are revolving around the centre of the galaxy. Just as the Earth travels around the Sun, the Sun and our entire solar system is traveling around the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy at a speed of 250 km/s. Even though we are travelling incredibly fast, it takes the Sun about 225 million years to complete one orbit around the galaxy centre. The Milky Way is truly massive, measuring a staggering 950 000 000 000 000 000 km across!</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If learners are familiar with scientific notation, then the above diameter of the Milky Way can be written as 9.5 x 1017 km.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>If you could shrink the solar system so that the distance from the Sun to Pluto is 2.5 cm, the Milky Way would have a diameter of 2000 km (about the distance from Durban to Windhoek!)</p>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>To us the Earth seems big, but the Earth is only a very small part of the Solar System. And our Solar System is a very small part of the Milky Way Galaxy. And our galaxy is only a very small part of the whole Universe.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr8eb02-gd-0003.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The Sun's position in the Milky Way.</figcaption></figure><p>If, instead of looking down on the Milky Way Galaxy, you looked at it from one side you would see that the Galaxy looks like this:</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb02-gd-0004.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Looking at the Milky Way from the side.</figcaption></figure><p>The Milky Way is shaped like a giant fried egg. It is about a hundred times wider than it is thick, and it bulges in the middle. The central lump is called the <strong>bulge</strong> and the rest of the galaxy outside the bulge is called the <strong>disk</strong>.</p>

<p>As you know, we are inside the Milky Way Galaxy. So when you look at the thin milky-looking band stretching across the sky at night, what do you think you are actually looking at?</p>

<p>The thin band of light that you see is actually the stars in the Sagittarius arm as you look inwards towards the centre of the galaxy. There are so many stars densely packed together that you cannot make out individual stars with your eyes. Therefore you just see a haze of light. Above and below the plane of the disk there are very few stars.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the image of the Milky Way above, you can see several round fuzzy blobs dotted about above and below the disk. These are called <strong>globular clusters</strong> and are vast collections of hundreds of thousands of ancient stars tightly packed together by gravity. The Milky Way has an estimated 160 globular clusters. The oldest stars in the galaxy are found in these globular clusters, some are almost as old as the Universe itself.</p>

<p>The aim of this activity is to reinforce the idea that the Milky Way Galaxy is a spiral galaxy with five major spiral arms in addition to some smaller arms. Learners will also be reminded that the Sun and Earth are not at the centre of the galaxy, but rather about half way out along a minor arm called the Orion Arm.</p>

<p>How do you think astronomers know what the Milky Way looks like from the outside when they have never been outside the Milky Way? The task is similar to trying to figure out the shape of a forest from outside when you are in the middle of the forest. How would you go about this?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learner-dependent answer. Ask learners to explain their answers. A typical response could be that we count the number of stars we see in each direction.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Astronomers look at the sky in all directions and count the number of stars that they see, they also measure the distance to each of the stars so that they can build up a three dimensional map of the galaxy. One of the difficulties that astronomers have in doing this is seeing through all the dust in the galaxy which dims the optical light coming from the stars.</p>

</div><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Make the Milky Way</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In this activity learners will make a model of the Milky Way. They must come up with the best materials they can think of and obtain for their models. For example, they can use cardboard, cotton wool balls and glitter. This can be done as a group model, where learners are given the task a couple days before the lesson and they must collect the materials, or else you can supply a selection of materials in class which they can then use to build the model. Encourage learners to be creative when thinking about the materials to use to represent the different components.</p>

<p>The aim of this activity is to give learners a three dimensional view of the Milky Way, including the structure of the central bulge and the disk containing the spiral arms. The glitter is used to represent the distribution of stars and the colours are used to demonstrate how old and young stars are distributed in the galaxy. The life cycle of stars in not covered until Grade 9. Therefore, although you may want to mention that the stellar populations in the bulge and the disk of our galaxy are different, it is not essential to do so.</p>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>You need to build a 3 dimensional model of the Milky Way Galaxy. You will either need to collect the most appropriate materials for your model beforehand, or else your teacher will supply you with a selection of materials to use in class.</li>
<li>Cut out a circle of radius 15 cm from the black card and use this to build your 3D model.</li>
<li>You must show the central bulge, the spiral arms and the different coloured stars.</li>
<li>Mark the position of our Sun on your model.</li>
<li>Using your model, view it from different angles and compare the view you have with the images of the Milky Way in this chapter.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners must come up with their own model designs. An example design is included here if you would prefer to make one which you then use to demonstrate to learners, instead of them making their own:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Build a dome of cotton balls in the centre of one side of the cardboard. Use glue to keep the cotton balls in place. The dome should be about 8 cm across and 4cm high.</li>
<li>Repeat on other side of the board. The cotton ball dome represents the bulge of our galaxy.</li>
<li>Pull the outer cotton balls into six spirals around the cotton ball dome. These represent the five major spiral arms found in the disk of our galaxy, in addition to the minor spiral arm that our Sun is found in.</li>
<li>Dribble glue on the spiral arms and sprinkle blue and silver glitter on the glue. These represent hot newly forming stars.</li>
<li>Dribble glue all over the cotton wool dome ball in the middle and sprinkle this glue with gold and red glitter to represent cooler, older stars.</li>
<li>Mark a position 8 cm from the centre inside one of the spiral arms.</li>
<li>Stick the star sticker on the spiral arm at the marked position. This marks the position of our Sun.</li>
<li>Make a hole in the centre of the model and thread it with a string so that it can be hung up.</li>

<p>The Sun is our closest star, and is <em>only</em> 150 million kilometres from Earth. When you look up at the sky at night, if you are lucky enough to be far from the glare of city lights, you can see thousands of stars. For those of you in a city, perhaps you can see hundreds of stars, depending on the amount of light pollution from street lights and other light sources. As you know, there are actually billions of stars in our galaxy but most of them are too faint to see from Earth.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>A constellation is a group of stars that, when viewed from Earth, form a pattern in the sky.</p>
</div>
<p>Of the brighter stars, one famous <strong>constellation</strong> that is visible, even from big cities in South Africa, is the Southern Cross or Crux. The two bright stars at the bottom left pointing towards the cross are called the pointers.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>You can find south using the Southern Cross Constellation. Just extend the long axis of the cross 4 times and then go straight down to the horizon to find south.</p>

This star is called <strong>Alpha Centauri</strong> and is our closest easily visible star after the Sun. Alpha Centauri is actually part of a triple star system which is where three stars are in orbit around each other. The two main stars of the system are called Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. They orbit close together, on average about eleven times the Earth-Sun distance from each other.</p>

<p>A smaller, fainter star, called <strong>Proxima Centauri</strong>, orbits much farther out. If you were to look at Alpha Centauri through a small telescope, instead of one star you would be able to make out the two separate stars Alpha Centauri A and B next to each other. Proxima Centauri is much fainter and further away from the other two so you would not see this one with the other two.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb02-gd-0007.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A comparison of the sizes of the Alpha Centauri star system and the Sun.</figcaption></figure><p>Proxima Centauri, the closest star to our own Sun, is about 40 trillion km away from the Earth. Alpha Centauri A and B are slightly farther away, at 42 trillion km away from us. Our closest star is 694 times farther away than Pluto is. These numbers are astronomically large! As the numbers are so large, astronomers do not use kilometres to measure the distances to stars, but use larger units based on the speed of light, which you will discover in the next section of this chapter.</p>

<p>The following is an <strong>optional, extension activity</strong> that you can do on scientific notation with your learners. Scientific notation is only covered in Gr 9 Mathematics, however. many of the numbers used in this chapter are very long, and so can be written in scientific notation. Also, if you do some of the subsequent activities doing calculations with a calculator, the answers will be given in scientific notation. It is therefore useful for learners to know what this is. You can use the following activity to explain scientific notation to learners and write some of the examples given in the tables on the board as examples.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Scientific notation</strong></p>

<p>In science one often needs to work with very large or very small numbers. For example, we spoke about the distance from Earth to our next closest star after the Sun as being 40 trillion km. How much is a trillion?</p>

<p>Look at the following table:</p>
<table><tr><td><p><strong>In words</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>In number format</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>In scientific notation</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>one thousand</p></td><td><p>1 000</p></td><td><p>1,0 x 103</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>one million</p></td><td><p>1 000 000</p></td><td><p>1,0 x 106</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>one billion</p></td><td><p>1 000 000 000</p></td><td><p>1,0 x 109</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>one trillion</p></td><td><p>1 000 000 000 000</p></td><td><p>1,0 x 1012</p></td></tr></table><p>Therefore, the distance from Earth to Proxima Centauri is 40 000 000 000 000 km. This is a very large number to work with.</p>

<p>Very large and very small numbers can be written more easily (and more compactly) in <strong>scientific notation</strong>, in the general form:</p>

<p>N x 10n</p>

<p>N is a decimal number between 0 and 10 that is rounded off to a few decimal places. n is known as the exponent and is an integer.</p>

<p>If n is bigger than 0 it represents how many times the decimal place in N should be moved to the <strong>right</strong>. If n is smaller than 0, then it represents how many times the decimal place in N should be moved to the <strong>left</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, 3,24 x 103 represents 3240 (the decimal moved three places to the right) and 3,24 x 10-3 represents 0,00324 (the decimal moved three places to the left).</p>

<p>If we wanted to write the distance from the Earth to Proxima Centauri in scientific notation, we need to count how many times the decimal comma must move so that N is a number between 0 and 10. It must move 13 times. Therefore 40 000 000 000 000 km can be written as 4,0 x 1013 km.</p>

<p>Look at the following examples.</p>
<table><tr><td><p><strong>Standard number</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Scientific notation</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>200</p></td><td><p>2 x 102</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1 500</p></td><td><p>1,5 x 103</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>67 890</p></td><td><p>6,789 x 104</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>48 000 210</p></td><td><p>4,8 x 107</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>0,02</p></td><td><p>2 x 10-2</p></td></tr></table><p/>
</div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Light years, light hours and light minutes</h2><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In this section, learners will be introduced to the concept of light years, light hours and light minutes. These units of <em>distance</em> are used for interstellar (between stars) and interplanetary (between planets) distances because the distances involved are huge and familiar units like metres and kilometres are just too small.</p>

<p>Because of the references to time in each of these distance units, learners can often mistake these units as units of time rather than units of distance. It is important to address this misconception. For example, a light hour is the distance that light travels in one hour of time. Although time is involved the final measurement is actually a distance.</p>

<p>A useful activity to introduce the topic is to ask learners how far they <em>estimate</em> they could walk, run and cycle in one hour. Although they have to use time in their estimation they should understand that they are estimating a <em>distance.</em> This example also includes the concept of speed. Learners should understand that if they move faster they will travel further in a given hour. Starting off by using activities that they are familiar with should prove useful when then going on to deal with the rather abstract concept of the speed of light.</p>

<p>This section is fairly mathematical and learners will need a calculator to complete the activities. It is useful (although not essential) if learners understand scientific notation. Learners need to understand what a million, billion and trillion correspond to and so if in doubt it might prove useful to remind learners of the powers of ten involved for millions, billions and trillions. Formulae for calculations have been provided where necessary, and it is expected that most learners will be familiar with the formula <em>speed = distance / time.</em> If learners are unfamiliar with this concept it would be a useful exercise to explain this before starting on the exercises in this section.</p>

<p>Our solar system is a pretty big place. Our nearest neighbour, the Moon, is on average 384 400 kilometres away, and the closest to us that our nearest planet Venus gets is about 42 million kilometres. The Sun is about 150 million kilometres away and the closest that Pluto can ever get to us is 4.3 billion kilometres. These large numbers are impractical to use and so we rather use much larger distance units based on the speed of light. This makes the numbers smaller and easier to deal with.</p>

<p>This is just like using metres instead of centimetres to make the numbers smaller when you measure a distance. For example, if you are telling a friend how far it is from your house to school, you would say it is 7.5 km, and not 7 500 000 cm. Let's begin by comparing the speed of light with the speed of some other things that move very fast.</p>

<p>For distances within the solar system, astronomers use units called <strong>light hours</strong> and <strong>light minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>A light hour is the <strong>distance</strong> that light travels in one hour. Despite its name, a light hour is not a unit of time, it is a <strong>unit of distance</strong>.</p>

<p>What do you think a light minute corresponds to?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is the distance that light travels in one minute.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Which do you think is a smaller distance, a light hour or a light minute, and why?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A light minute is smaller because the light has less time to travel in a minute than an hour. So a light minute must be shorter because this represents the distance that light travels in a minute.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Astronomers use units called <strong>light years</strong> to measure the distances between stars and galaxies. One light year is almost 10 trillion kilometres. As you can see, a light year is very, very far.</p>

<p>Light years, light hours and light minutes measure distances. They also tell us something else very interesting. If you measure the distance to a light source in light travel time, you can work out how long light emitted from the distant source takes to reach you. Light that is emitted from an object one light year away from you, takes one year to reach your eyes. Similarly, light that is emitted from an object one light hour away, takes one hour to reach your eyes. How long do you think light emitted from one light minute away takes to reach your eyes?</p>

<p>This may sound very strange to you because when you switch on a lamp in your home you see the light straight away. You do not have to wait for the light from the lamp to reach you. You do not notice that it actually takes some time for the light from the lamp to reach your eyes because light travels extremely fast. Light travels so fast, that if you were standing a metre away from the lamp it would only take only three billionths of a second for the light from the lamp to reach your eyes. It is therefore no surprise that you don't notice the delay.</p>

<p>In this section learners will find out what lies beyond our own galaxy. They will learn that there are billions of other galaxies in our Universe of all shapes and sizes. They will learn about the different types of galaxies, i.e. ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals, lenticular and irregular types. Learners <strong>do not</strong> have to know the actual names of the different shapes (this is included for interest), but they must know the shape of the Milky Way Galaxy and understand that other galaxies have different shapes. The will also look at how galaxies are arranged in the Universe: into groups and clusters of galaxies, and finally they will look at the Universe on its grandest scale finding out how matter is arranged into voids and filaments.</p>

<p>Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is only one out of a total of about 100 to 200 billion galaxies that astronomers estimate to be in the <strong>Universe</strong>. That's more than 10 times the total number of people on Earth.</p>

<p>As well as stars, galaxies contain vast amounts of gas and dust. Galaxies come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The Milky Way is an average-sized spiral galaxy: it is 100 000 light years across and contains around 200 billion stars. Small galaxies may contain only a few million stars, while large galaxies can have several trillion stars.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The distances between galaxies are even larger than the sizes of galaxies and are measured in millions or even billions of light years.</p>
</div>
<p>Our closest galaxy neighbour is called the Andromeda Galaxy. Andromeda is 2.5 <em>million</em> light years away from the Milky Way. If you wanted to travel to Andromeda and could travel as fast as light, it would still take you 2.5 million years to get there.</p>

<p>Extra information on the different shapes of galaxies:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Spiral galaxies have a central bulge and a flat disk with spiral arms.</li>
<li>
<p>Some spiral galaxies have arms that do not start at the centre of the galaxy but start at the end of a bright straight <em>bar</em> that goes across the centre of the galaxy. These are called barred spiral galaxies.</p>
</li>
<li>Elliptical galaxies look smooth and are shaped like giant rugby balls with no spiral arms. Some can be round and some can be very elongated. They contain old stars and have very little gas and dust.</li>
<li>A lenticular galaxy is in between a spiral galaxy and an elliptical galaxy. They are disk galaxies (like spiral galaxies) but do not have defined arms as they have lost most of their dust and gas. As a result, there is little star formation happening and they consist of mostly old stars (like elliptical galaxies.)</li>
<li>Irregular galaxies do not look like spirals or elliptical galaxies. Some (but not all) irregular galaxies are actually two or more galaxies in the process of colliding.</li>

<p><strong>Extension content and activity</strong></p>

<p>Galaxy clusters are beautiful yet peculiar objects. They seem to be full of a mysterious unseen type of matter which has not yet been identified. From its gravitational effects on the gas and galaxies in the cluster, astronomers estimate that this strange matter could be about five times more massive than all the galaxies and hot gas in a cluster combined. Astronomers have no idea what this mysterious matter is and call it <strong>dark matter,</strong> because they cannot see it. It turns out that this strange matter is not only found in clusters of galaxies, but is spread throughout space.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8eb02-gd-0033.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The galaxy cluster called Abell 2218. Each point of light is a galaxy.</figcaption></figure><p>If you look closely at the image of galaxy cluster Abell 2218, in addition to the galaxies that make up the cluster you can see thin arcs. These are images of distant galaxies behind the cluster that are distorted by matter in the cluster. The cluster of galaxies acts like a giant lens, bending and distorting the light coming from the more distant galaxies. The distant galaxies are not actually this funny shape, they are usually elliptical or spiral shaped. They just appear this way because of the lensing.</p>

<p>Matter bends light, just like a lens does, although the effect is much weaker, otherwise our torches would have bent light beams. When matter acts to bend light astronomers refer to the matter as a gravitational lens. Clusters of galaxies make excellent gravitational lenses because they are so massive. Most of the lensing however does not come from the galaxies or the hot gas in the cluster, but from the unseen dark matter within the cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Activity: Wine glass gravitational lens</strong></p>

<p><em>
             <strong>Note</strong>: This activity can be done as an extension if you decide to discuss the above content on dark matter with learners. However, this is beyond the scope of CAPS and has only been included as an optional extension. This activity can be done individually, but if there are not enough wine glasses for the entire class then learners can work in small groups and take it in turns within their group to complete this activity. It can sometimes be a bit difficult to see the rings and arcs clearly. To aid this, use a bright red pen rather than a black pen, and it may help if learners close one eye and just use one eye to observe the arcs and rings produced in this activity.
          </em></p>

<p>In this activity you will investigate how a wine glass acts like a lens, bending light. Dark matter in the Universe also acts like a lens, bending the light from distant galaxies making their images distorted into rings or arcs. While the wine glass bends the light due to refraction, dark matter bends the light because it has mass, and is called a gravitational lens.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>wine glass</li>
<li>paper (graph paper if possible)</li>
<li>red pen/marker</li>
<li>water</li>
</ul><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Make a large dot on the graph paper using the red marker.</li>
<li>Place the wine glass on the graph paper and look directly down at the paper through the wine glass. Observe how it distorts the grid of the graph paper.</li>
<li>Centre the wine glass over the dot and look directly down at the paper through the wine glass. Make a note of your observations below.</li>
<li>Move the wine glass from side to side and up and down along the paper slightly and note what you observe.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 to 4, but this time raise the glass above the paper by about 3 cm. Note what you observe.</li>
<li>Add some water to the wine glass and repeat step 5. Note what you observe.</li>
</ol><p><em>
            <strong>Note:</strong> If the dot is centred below the wine glass, learners should view a ring. If it is not centred, they should see arcs.</em></p>

<p><strong>Ask learners the following questions:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p>When the wine glass was centred above the dot what did you observe?</p>

<p><em>Red ring</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the wine glass was not centred what did you observe?</p>

<p><em>Red arcs</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you moved the wine glass left and right, what happened?</p>

<p><em>The arcs move. If you move the glass to the left, the arc is on the right hand side and if you move the glass to the right, the arc appears on the left hand side.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given your observations here, what can you say about the orientation of the galaxy cluster Abell 2218, shown in the last image? Is it in line with the distant galaxies or offset slightly? (Hint: do you see arcs or a ring?)</p>

<p><em>In the picture above you can see faint arcs in the image. This means that the gravitational lens and the background galaxies cannot be lined up perfectly, otherwise you would see a ring.</em></p>

<p>Learners do not need to know the structure of the Universe in terms of filaments and voids. This is included as enrichment content. Learners do need to know what we mean by the observable Universe though.</p>

<p>There is an error in the CAPS document which incorrectly states that the size of the observable Universe is 28 billion light years. In fact the size of the observable Universe is about 93 billion light years which corresponds to 28 billion parsecs - a parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy and is equal to about 3.1x1013 km or about 3.3 light years.</p>

<p>Note that the observable Universe, is the region that is visible from Earth it is not the whole of the Universe. The size of the whole Universe is unknown and it may be infinite in size. "Infinite in size" is a difficult concept for most learners to grasp and so it has been deliberately omitted from this text. You should use your own judgement as to whether it is suitable to consider elaborating upon the size of the unobservable Universe within your class.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>On the largest scales the Universe resembles a giant bath sponge. The galaxy clusters are arranged in thin walls called <strong>filaments</strong>. Between the filaments are huge gaps which contain very few galaxies and so are called <strong>voids</strong>.</p>

This might make you imagine that you can see objects from as far as 13.7 billion light years away in all directions. If you were to draw a sphere around the Earth, with a radius of 13.7 billion light years, with the Earth placed at the centre, the surface of the sphere would represent the limit of how far light could travel to Earth in 13.7 billion years. The surface would represent the edge of the <em>observable Universe as seen from Earth</em>. You might therefore assume that the diameter of the <strong>observable Universe</strong> is 27.4 billion light years (2 times 13.7).</p>

</div>
<p>However, you would actually be wrong. Astronomers estimate the size of the observable Universe to be 93 billion light years in diameter, which is much, much larger. The reason that the size is much larger than expected is because the Universe is expanding and galaxies are moving further and further away from the Earth as the space between them expands. So we are able to see galaxies that are now very far away because when they emitted their light they were closer to Earth. The size of the whole Universe, which includes regions too far from Earth for us to see at this time, is unknown.</p>

<p>Learners must draw the spiral shape of the galaxy from above. The exact positioning of the arms is not important, but learners must show the position of the Sun towards the edge of one of the arms, Orion. From the edge on, learners must show a flat disk with a bulge in the middle, and they must locate the position of the Sun towards the one side of the disk.</p>
