<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>In previous grades the learners investigated circuits and current electricity. In this chapter they are introduced to static electricity. It explains how static electricity is caused by friction between objects and that charged objects are either positively or negatively charged. There are several activities in this chapter which illustrate the effects of static electricity.</p>

<p>An interesting article on how to encourage learners to pursue STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) careers:<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth">[link]</a><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/19Bpoip">bit.ly/19Bpoip</a></p>

<p>The effects of <strong>static electricity</strong> are all around us, but we do not always recognise it when we see or feel them. Or perhaps you have, but you never realised what was causing it. For example, have you ever felt a slight shock when you put a jersey over your head on a cold day, or perhaps you have observed your hair stand on end when you touch certain objects? Let's do a quick activity to demonstrate static electricity.</p>

<p>You can also do this activity using a plastic comb rather than balloons. Or else you can use pieces of paper instead of a learner's hair as not all hair will behave in the following way if it has product in it. You can then rather rub the balloon on a jersey and pick up pieces of paper.</p>

</div>

<p>Let's look at an everyday example of static electricity. Sometimes when you comb your hair with a plastic comb your hair stands on end and makes crackling sounds. How does this happen?</p>

<p>You have dragged the surface of the plastic comb against the surfaces of your hair. When two surfaces are rubbed together there is <strong>friction</strong> between them. Friction is a resistance against the movement of an object as a result of its contact with another object. This means that when you rubbed the plastic comb along your hair, your hair resisted the movement of the comb and slowed it down.</p>

<p>The friction between two surfaces can cause electrons to be transferred from one surface to the other.</p>

<p>In order to understand how electrons can be transferred, we need to remember what we learned about the structure of an atom last term in Matter and Materials.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm2091472"><img src="images/gr8ec01-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><p>All atoms have a nucleus which contains protons and neutrons. The nucleus is held together by a very strong force, which means that the protons within a nucleus can be considered to be fixed there. The atom also contains electrons. Where are the electrons arranged in the atom?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The electrons are arranged in the space around the nucleus.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What is the charge on a proton?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Positive charge.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What is the charge on an electron?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Negative charge.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What is the charge on a neutron?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Neutrons are not charged. They are neutral.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The atom is held together by the <strong>electrostatic attraction</strong>between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons. Within an atom, the electrons closest to the nucleus are the most strongly held, whilst those further away experience a weaker attraction.</p>

<p>Normally, atoms contain the same number of protons and electrons. This means that atoms are normally <strong>neutral</strong> because they have the same number of positive charges as negative charges, so the charges balance each other out. All objects are made up of atoms and since atoms are normally neutral, objects are also usually neutral.</p>

<p>However, when we rub two surfaces together, like when you comb your hair or rub a balloon against your hair, the friction can cause electrons to be transferred from one object to another. Remember, the protons are fixed in place in the nucleus and so they cannot be transferred between atoms, it is only electrons that are able to be transferred to another surface. Some objects give up electrons more easily than other objects. Look at the following diagram which explains how this happens.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp956416"><img src="images/gr8ec01-gd-0003.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Which object gave up some of its electrons in the diagram?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The hair.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Does this object now have more positive or more negative charges?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It has more positive charges.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Which object gained electrons in the diagram?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The comb.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Does this object now have more positive or more negative charges?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It has more negative charges.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>When an object has more electrons than protons overall, then we say that the object is <strong>negatively charged</strong>.</p>

<p>When an object has fewer electrons than protons overall, then we say that the object is <strong>positively charged</strong>.</p>

<p>Have a look at the following diagram which illustrates this.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm10095328"><img src="images/gr8ec01-gd-0004.png" width="300"/></figure><p>So, we now understand the transfer of electrons that takes place as a result of friction between objects. But, how did that result in your hair rising when you brought the charged balloon close to your hair in the last activity? Let's look at what happens when oppositely charged objects are brought together.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Turning the wheel</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is a fun demonstration of how like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. If you have enough materials, allow the learners to try this themselves. If you don't have enough materials, do this as a demonstration but give the learners a chance to play a bit.</p>

<p>Practise this activity a few times first to make sure that you have the method right. Remember that it is quite easy to accidently earth the rods so work with care. This will work best on a dry day. This will be dependent on the area which you live in.</p>

<p>At a brainstorming workshop with volunteer teachers and academics at the beginning of 2013, we filmed a quick demonstration of this task when the group was discussing it. You can view this short clip here: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1fFbbbJ">bit.ly/1fFbbbJ</a></p>

<p>The pieces of paper were attracted to the plastic rod.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>When we rubbed the perspex rods with the cloth, electrons were transferred from the perspex to the cloth. What charge do the perspex rods now have?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A positive charge.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Both the perspex rods now have the <strong>same</strong> charge. Did you notice that objects with the same charge tend to push each other away? We say that they are <strong>repelling</strong> each other.</p>

<p>When we rubbed the plastic rod with the cloth, electrons were transferred from the cloth to the plastic rod. What charge does the plastic rod now have?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A negative charge.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The perspex rod and the plastic rod now have <strong>opposite</strong> charges. Did you notice that objects with different charge tend to pull each other together? We say that they are <strong>attracting</strong> each other.</p>

<p>In the example of the pieces of paper being attracted to the ruler, the paper starts off neutral. However, as the negatively charged plastic rod is brought closer, the electrons in the paper that are nearest to the rod will begin to move away, leaving behind a positive charge on the surfaces of the paper that are nearest to the rod. The paper is therefore attracted to the rod because opposite charges attract. Another example is dust that is attracted to newly polished glasses.</p>

<p>We have now observed the fundamental behaviour of charges.</p>

<p>In summary, we can say:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>If two negatively charged objects are brought close together, then they will repel each other.</li>
<li>If two positively charged objects are brought close together, then they will repel each other.</li>
<li>If a positively charged object is brought near to a negatively charged object, they will attract each other.</li>
</ul><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Remember, <strong>like charges repel</strong> and <strong>opposite charges attract.</strong></p>

<p>Do you now understand why your hair rises and is attracted to the balloon after you rub the balloon on your hair? Write a short description to explain what is happening using the words: electrons, transfer, negative charge, positive charge, opposite, attract, repel.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>When rubbing hair with the balloon, electrons are transferred from the hair to the balloon. The balloon now has a negative charge and the hair has a positive charge. They have opposite charges and so when the balloon is brought close to the hair again, they attract each other. Since the hair strands each have positive charges, like charges repel and the hair strands repel each other, also causing them to rise up.</p>

<p>A large build-up of charge on an object can be dangerous. When electrons transfer from a charged object to a neutral object we say that the charged object has discharged.</p>

<p>Discharging can take place when the objects touch each other. But the electrons can also transfer from one object to another when they are brought close, but not touching. When electrons move across an air gap they can heat the air enough to make it glow. The glow is called a <strong>spark</strong>.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec01-gd-0006.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An electrostatic spark between two objects.</figcaption></figure><p>Sparks can be harmless, but they can also be very dangerous. Sparks can cause <strong>flammable</strong> materials to <strong>ignite</strong>. You will probably have noticed that you may not smoke cigarettes or have open flames near petrol tanks at petrol stations. This is because petrol fumes are very explosive and only need a small amount of heat to start them burning. A small electrostatic spark is enough to ignite flammable petrol fumes.</p>

<p/>

<p>This video in the Visit box shows how static electricity from the flowing petrol causes a spark which ignites the petrol fumes and leads to a large fire. It is an illustration of one of the dangers of static electricity.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Electrostatic discharge can also cause <strong>electric shocks</strong>. Have you ever been shocked by a shopping trolley while you are pushing it around a shop? Or have you walked across a carpeted room and then shocked yourself when you touch the door handle to leave the room? You have experienced an electric discharge. Electrons move from the door handle onto your skin and the movement of the electrons causes a small electric shock. Small electric shocks can be uncomfortable but mostly harmless. Large electric shocks are extremely dangerous and can cause injury and death.</p>

</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The discharge of electrons from charged objects happens much more easily when the air is dry, which is why you are more likely to experience electrostatic sparks or shocks in dry weather. This is because when the weather is humid, the moisture in the air can collect on the surface of objects, and prevent the build-up of electrical charge. The charge dissipates through the moisture, which is a better conductor than air.</p>
</div>
<p>Do you know where else we can see sparks due to static electricity? Look at the photo for a clue!</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec01-gd-0007.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Lightning is a huge electrostatic discharge.</figcaption></figure><p>During a thunderstorm, there is friction in the atmosphere between the particles that make up clouds, causing the build-up of regions of charge. Once the difference in charge between two regions becomes great enough, electrostatic discharge becomes possible. A lightning flash is a massive discharge between charged regions within clouds, or between clouds and the Earth.</p>

<p>In order to discharge extra electrons safely from an object we must earth it. <strong>Earthing</strong> means that we connect the charged object to the ground (the Earth) with an electrical conductor. The extra electrons travel along the conductor and enter the ground without causing any harm. The Earth is so large that the extra charge does not have any overall effect.</p>

<p>For example, think of the metal trolleys in shopping centres. Have you ever noticed that they normally have a metal chain hanging at the bottom which drags along the floor? This is to earth the trolley if it gets a charge so that charge cannot build up on the trolley. This protects the person pushing the trolley from getting a shock.</p>

<p>We are now going to look at two instruments which demonstrate static electricity.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Van de Graaff generator</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If you do not have a Van de Graaff generator then you can use some of the videos provided here which show and explain how the generator works. If you do have a generator then allowing the learners to "play" with it will give them a good insight into the effects of static electricity. Allow learners to perform different activities, such as having their hair stand on end.</p>

<p>Let the learners hold onto the dome and then run the generator until their hair stands on end.</p>

<p>Tear up small pieces of paper and place them on the top of the uncharged dome, run the generator and the pieces will become charged and then fly off the generator. This is a good example of the pieces of paper becoming charged and then, because they all have the same charge, repelling each other.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The Van de Graaff generator is a machine which uses friction to generate a large build-up of electric charge on a metal dome.</p>

</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The fundamental idea of using friction in a machine to generate a charge dates back to the 17th century, but the generator was only invented by Robert Van de Graaff in 1929 at Princeton University.</p>
</div>
<p>The Van de Graaff generator can be used to demonstrate the effects of an electrostatic charge. The big metal dome at the top becomes positively charged when the generator is turned on. When the dome is charged it can be discharged by bringing another insulated metal sphere close to the dome. The electrons will jump to the dome from the metal sphere and cause a spark.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>When you touch the positively charged dome, electrons are transferred from you to the dome to discharge it. This causes you and your hair to become positively charged. The individual hair strands are then positively charged so they repel each other and stand on end.</p>

<p>An electroscope is an early scientific instrument used to identify the presence of a charged object or it can be used to identify the type of charge on a charged object.</p>

There is a metal rod hanging down and at the end are two strips of thin gold foil attached to it. A disc or ball is attached to the top of the metal rod, as seen in the illustrations above. When the metal ball or disc at the top is touched with a charged object, or a charged object is brought near to it, the gold foil strips spread apart, indicating that the object has a charge.</p>

<p>Look at the next illustration which shows how this works.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm8619632"><img src="images/gr8ec01-gd-0012.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The positively charged rod attracts electrons to the disc from the gold foil strips.

<p>If you cannot find glass jars with lids then it is possible to make lids. Use old plastic tub lids and cut out a circle the same size as the opening of the glass jar. Then use electrical tape (or even masking tape) to hold the plastic lid in place over the jar opening.</p>

<p>The copper does not have to be 14 gauge but the thicker the piece the better it holds it's shape.</p>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">

<p/><p/>

          
<p>The aluminium foil pieces move back together.</p>

          
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Why do the pieces of aluminium foil move apart? When you rubbed the plastic ruler with the wool cloth, the ruler became negatively charged. When the negatively charged ruler is brought close to the copper wire, the electrons on the wire are repelled downwards towards the aluminium foil. The pieces of aluminium foil then have extra electrons on them and they both become negatively charged. Two objects which are negatively charged will repel each other and so the pieces of aluminium foil move away from each other.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This next question is a test of the learners' understanding of the fact that positive charges do not move to cause charging, only electrons can move. But, a positively charged object can move. Learners often get confused with this. Give them a chance to reason out the answer themselves. Allow them to bring a positively charged object close to the electroscope to observe what happens and then try to figure out why the effect is seemingly the same. Rubbing a glass rod with the wool cloth will cause a positive charge to develop on the glass rod.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>When a positively charged object is brought close to the electroscope the negative electrons are attracted towards the positively charged object and move up through the copper wire. This means that the pieces of aluminium have lost some electrons and so have an overall positive charge. Both pieces of aluminium foil are then positively charged. Like charges repel each other and so the pieces of aluminium foil move apart from each other.</p>

<p>Rubbing the ruler with a cloth transfers electrons from the cloth to the ruler so the ruler now has an excess of electrons and it is negatively charged. The pieces of paper are neutral. When the negatively charged ruler is brought near to the paper pieces, they are attracted to the ruler as the the electrons move around on the paper because of the large charge on the ruler.
