<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>3 weeks</p>

<p>This chapter builds on the work done in Grade 7. In Grade 7, learners investigated basic circuits, as well as energy transfers within a system. In Grade 8, learners will practice drawing electrical circuits using the correct circuit symbols. This was first introduced in primary school, so learners should be familiar with the circuit diagram symbols, however, some revision might be necessary. It is important to remind learners that circuit diagrams are just schematics of a circuit. When building a real circuit from a diagram, the real circuit will not look exactly the same as the diagram.</p>

<p>A common misconception which develops in circuit building is that black wires carry negative current and red wires carry positive current. This happens because of the colour coding often used on electrical meters to indicate polarity. In order to avoid this misconception, sometimes red wires can be used to connect the negative side of the battery to the negative side of the meters, or sometimes only use one colour of wire. This shows that the colour coding is arbitrary.</p>

<p>If you do not have sufficient equipment to allow all the learners to make all the circuits or you want to experiment with simulations, you can use the PhET simulation for building an electric circuit. You can use the PhET simulation software which can be downloaded from</p>

<p><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/GzA9d5">bit.ly/GzA9d5</a>. You can then run an offline version on your computers.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you have an internet connection, or if learners wish to use their mobile phones, these simulations will run directly within your browser from our website,<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.curious.org.za">[link]</a><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.curious.org.za">www.curious.org.za</a></p>

<p>Before allowing your students to use the PhET simulations there are several things you should familiarise yourself with regarding the software. Make sure you know how to:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>add components to a circuit. You need to click, hold down and drag the components from the side of the screen to where you want them.</li>
<li>connect components with wires. You can place a wire onto the screen and then drag the ends till they meet up with the component. Make sure that you are careful when connecting light bulbs. The system will create a short circuit if they are not connected correctly. This will require some practice.</li>
<li>delete wires or components or add parts. You can't just add after the circuit is built, just as in a real circuit you need to disconnect components to make space for new ones. Right-click with the mouse on the junction between two components and it will give you the option to disconnect. Right-click on the component itself, and you will be given the option to remove the entire component.</li>
<li>use the voltmeter and ammeter. The non-contact ammeter is very useful but the other one is more realistic.</li>
<li>clear the image to start something else. Your learners can save their circuits for future use if your lesson is interrupted and then load them again when you need them. If they need a blank screen in order to start again, then click on the "reset all" button.</li>
<li>reset the resistance of a resistor or light bulb or to change the potential difference of a battery. Right-click on the component and you will be give the option to adjust the settings.</li>
</ul><p>If you only teach Natural Sciences, it is a good idea to check with the Technology teachers to see how these two curriculums complement each other, especially with regard to electricity. Some of the concepts which might be introduced for the first time in Natural Sciences, have already been covered in the Technology curriculum. Knowing what learners have already covered and been introduced to will help make your classes more efficient and more stimulating for learners.</p>

<p>In the last chapter we looked at static electricity. We are now going to focus on current electricity. You will already be familiar with some of the concepts and terminology about electricity from previous grades. This year we are going to revise some of these concepts and also extend our knowledge about electricity.</p>

<p>There is no need at this level to discuss the idea of conventional current. The idea of conventional current (the movement of positive charges) was developed prior to the discovery of electron movement. It was adopted as a convention so that all scientists working with electricity could communicate and compare research with ease. The mathematical models of electricity are also simpler when considering conventional current. The idea of conventional current and SI units and their importance will only be discussed in Grade 9.</p>

<p>An electric current is the movement of charge in a closed, conducting circuit. As we know from Chapter 1, and also from Matter and Materials, the electrons in an atom are arranged in the outer space around the central nucleus. We saw in the last chapter how electrons can be transferred between objects resulting in a charge on the object. In metals, the electrons are able to move freely within the metal. The electrons are not associated with a particular atom in the metal. We say electrons in a metal are <strong>delocalised</strong>. Have a look at the following diagram which shows this.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm5602240"><img src="images/gr8ec02-gd-0001.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>An ion is an atom that has a charge due to the loss or gain of electrons. Here the metal ions are positive as the electrons are delocalised.</p>
</div>
<p>Conducting wire in an electric circuit is made of metal. If we supply it with a source of energy and a complete circuit, then the electrons will all move in the same general direction through the wire. This movement of electrons through a conductor is <strong>electric current</strong>.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp3160256"><img src="images/gr8ec02-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Do you remember what you learned in Grade 6 and 7 about circuits? Let's revise briefly:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>An electric circuit needs a <strong>source of energy</strong> (a cell or battery).</p>
</li>
<li>Cells have positive and negative terminals.</li>
<li>
<p>A circuit is a <strong>complete pathway</strong> for electricity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The circuit must be <strong>closed</strong> in order for a device to work, such as a bulb which lights up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can say that an electric circuit is a <strong>closed system</strong> which transfers electrical energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A circuit is made up of various <strong>components</strong>, which we will look at in more detail.</p>

<p>All muscles in our bodies move in response to electrical impulses generated naturally in our bodies.</p>
</div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-4">Cells</h3>
<p>Electrical cells are the source of energy for the electric circuit. Where does that energy come from?</p>

<p>Inside the cell are a number of of chemicals. These chemicals store <strong>potential energy</strong>. When a cell is in a complete circuit, the chemicals react with each other. As a result, electrons are given the potential energy they need to start moving through the circuit. When the electrons move they have both potential and kinetic energy. The <strong>electric current</strong> is the movement of electrons through the conducting wires.</p>

<p>Cells come in many different sizes. Different sized cells provide different amounts of energy to the electrical circuit. The types of cells you would use in toys, torches and other small appliances range in size from AAA, AA, C, D, and 9-volt sizes. AAA, AA, C and D cells usually have a rating of 1,5V, but the larger cells have a larger capacity. This means that the larger cells will last longer before going 'flat'. A cell goes flat when it is no longer able to supply energy through its chemical reactions.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec02-gd-0020.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Different sized batteries.</figcaption></figure><p>When we buy cells in the shop they are usually referred to as batteries. This can be a bit confusing because a battery is really two or more cells connected together.

</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Resistors</h3>
<p>What are resistors? In order to work out what they are, let's first remind ourselves about conductors and insulators.</p>

<p>We are specifically looking at electricity so we can now talk about <strong>electrical conductors and insulators</strong>. An electrical conductor is a substance which allows electric charge to move through it. An insulator is a substance which does not allow electric charge to move through it.</p>

<p>Think back to our model of a metal wire and how the electrons are able to move through the wire. The metal wire is a conductor of electricity. Write down some materials which do not conduct electricity.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Some materials which do not conduct electricity are plastics, glass and ceramics.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Why do you think most conducting wires are surrounded with plastic?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is because plastic is an electrical insulator and therefore insulates the wire.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>Resistors</strong> are a bit of both. They allow electrons to move through them, but do not make it easy. They are said to <strong>resist</strong> the movement of electrons. Resistors therefore influence the electric current in a circuit.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Bring a kettle to school so that the learners can see the element inside the kettle. Also use a large, incandescent light bulb to show them the filament wire in the bulb as examples of resistors.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>But, why would we want to resist the movement of electrons? Resistors can be extremely useful. Think about a kettle. If you look inside you will see a large metal coil.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec02-gd-0021.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Looking inside a kettle.</figcaption></figure><p>This metal coil is the heating element. If you plug in and switch on the kettle, the element heats up and heats the water. The element is a large resistor. When the electrons move through the resistor they expend a lot of energy in overcoming the resistance. This energy is transferred to the surroundings in the form of heat. This heat is useful to us as it heats our water.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The first electric light was made in 1800 by a man called Humphry Davy. He invented an electric battery, and when he connected wires to it and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed as the carbon is a resistor, producing light.</p>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The inventor, Thomas Edison, experimented with thousands of different resistor materials until he eventually found the right material so that the bulb would glow for over 1500 hours.</p>
</div>
<p>A good example of where resistors are used is in light bulbs. Let's take a closer look at the different parts of a light bulb to see how it works.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Resistance in a light bulb</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Try to have some incandescent light bulbs for the learners to hold and to look at. For extension you could ask the learners to research the use of argon gas rather than normal air for the gas inside the light bulb. Argon is used because it is an inert gas and will prevent oxidation of the filament, therefore lengthening the lifespan of the filament.</p>

<p>The questions in this activity would be discussed and answered as you go through it in class. Learners might not know the answers,but after discussing how a light bulb works with them, they should then write their own answers.</p>

<p>A light bulb consists of an air-tight enclosed glass case (number 1). At the base of the bulb are two metal contacts (numbers 7 and 10), which connect to the ends of an electrical circuit. The metal contacts are attached to two stiff wires, (numbers 3 and 4).</p>

<p>These wires are attached to a thin metal filament. Have a look at a light bulb. Can you identify the filament? This is number 2 in the diagram. The filament is made from tungsten wire. This is an element with high resistance.</p>

<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">

<p>When the electrons move through the filament they experience high resistance. This means that they transfer a lot of their energy to the filament when they pass through.

<p>The amount of resistance a substance offers to the circuit is measured in ohms (&#937;). If we want to use resistors to control the current flow, then we need to know the amount of resistance. There are some common resistors shown in the photo.</p>

This isn't just to make them look pleasing to the eye. The coloured bands are actually a code that tells us the resistance of the resistor. We also get resistors where we can adjust the resistance ourselves. This is called a variable resistor. You have already seen the symbol for drawing a resistor in a circuit diagram.

<p>Why is the light bulb included in the circuit?</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>The light bulb is a good indicator of whether or not there is a current in the circuit. If the light bulb glows it means there is electric current. If the light does not glow it means that there is no current (or there is a very small current).</p>

          
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Sometimes though there might still be a very small electric current, but it does not provide enough energy to cause the light bulb to glow. This is why the light bulb gives a good indication, but an ammeter will provide the most definitive indication of whether there is a current or not.</p>

<p>In this activity, we just demonstrated how a <strong>fuse</strong> works. The steel wool acted as a fuse. When the current was too high, the steel wool melted and prevented any further current in the circuit.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-8">What are fuses?</h3>
<p>The heating effect of an electric current can be dangerous. If a circuit overheats it could cause a fire. To avoid overheating, circuits often contain a fuse. Fuses contain a low resistance wire made of a metal with a low melting point. Therefore, the piece of wire melt if it gets too hot, just like the steel wool in our activity.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec02-gd-0031.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An example of a fuse. Can you see the low melting point wire inside?</figcaption></figure><p>Different circuits need different strength currents and so we need different types of fuses. Some fuses can only handle a little bit of heat, some can handle a lot. We choose the fuse that suits the safety needs of our circuit. If the circuit overheats, the fuse will melt and break the circuit to reduce the danger of fire as well as protect electronic equipment.</p>

<p>How did you draw the fuse that we made using steel wool in the last activity? The conventional symbol for drawing a fuse in a circuit diagram is shown here:</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ec02-gd-0032.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A fuse.</figcaption></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>It is important to never remove a fuse from a circuit without first switching off the current. You could get a nasty shock if you do.</p>
</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-9">What is a short circuit?</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard that something broke because it <strong>short circuited</strong>? A short circuit happens when another, easier path is accidently made in an electric circuit. What do we mean by <em>easier</em>?</p>

<p>We mean that the path offers very little resistance to the electric current. As there is so little resistance the current flows along the short circuit and doesn't pass through the main circuit. Short circuits can be dangerous and cause a lot of damage to appliances.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a piece of toast get stuck in a toaster? It's a real nuisance. Lots of people are tempted to use their butter knife to unhook the bread. Don't be tempted. Your knife is a conductor and can act as a short circuit. All the electric current will flow through your knife and, because you are touching it, through you. What would be the safe way to unhook your toast?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Either switch off the toaster and then unhook the toast (safest idea!) or use an insulator (plastic) utensil to unhook the toast.</p>

<p>This activity is an opportunity for individual research. There will be other opportunities for group research. It is important that each learner is able to do basic research so that they are able to contribute effectively to a group research task. The learner should write a short paragraph detailing their research. There are many different household appliances which use fuses. Learners may choose any of them. Remember to make sure that all learners include references for any research they do. They need to learn from an early age to credit sources of information.</p>

<p>There are different types of fuses. The ones we have investigated so far require you to replace the fuse if the wire melts. However, some fuses work differently to break the circuit and can just be reset once the problem in the circuit is fixed.</p>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Most modern homes have <strong>circuit breakers</strong> instead of fuses. A circuit breaker is similar to a fuse in that it is designed to protect an electric circuit from damage, due to overload or a short circuit, by stopping the current flow. However, unlike a fuse which melts and must then be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset to start operating again. This can be done manually or take place automatically.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-10">Magnetic effect</h3>
<p>Before we look at how a current produces a magnetic field, let us first learn more about magnets. A magnet is a piece of material which produces a magnetic field. A magnet has a north pole and a south pole. Opposite poles will attract each other and the same poles will repel each other. A magnet has a magnetic field around it.</p>

<p>We saw from our first activity that plotting compasses react to magnetic fields. The plotting compasses changed direction when the current was switched on. This means there is a magnetic field around the wire. Was it there when the current was switched off? No, it was not. That means that the presence of the electric current in the wire must have produced a magnetic field.</p>

</ol><p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Here is a general description of each application.</p>

<p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>

<p>The voice coil of a speaker is an electromagnet. The power to the electromagnet is switched on and off in the same sequence as the incoming sound wave signal. This causes the magnetic field to switch on and off. When the magnetic field switches on and off the electromagnet moves backwards and forwards. This movement moves the diaphragm of the speaker and causes the air in front of the speaker to vibrate, causing a sound wave.</p>

<p><strong>Electric bells:</strong></p>

<p>The electric bell uses an electromagnet to move the striker backwards and forwards onto the bell itself. As the striker hits the bell the circuit is broken and the electromagnet switches off, a spring pulls the striker back into position, completing the circuit. When the circuit is complete the electromagnet switches back on and is attracted to the other magnet on the bell. The striker is then pulled to the bell. This process is completed until the bell is switched off.</p>

<p><strong>Telephones:</strong></p>

<p>The input sound from the person speaking is converted into an electrical signal which travels to the listener's device. The electrical signal has the same fluctuations and frequency as the speaker's voice. This current flows through a solenoid and causes an electromagnet to switch on and off. This causes the diaphragm to move in and out which causes a sound wave.</p>

<p><strong>Magnetic trains (MAGLEV):</strong></p>

<p>MAGLEV trains use the fact that magnets repel each other to power the trains. There are magnets on the track and on the bottom of the train. By alternating the current in the rails the train can be pulled forward by attraction between unlike poles and propelled forward by the repulsion of like poles. This website provides a good description: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1dTQQuM">bit.ly/1dTQQuM</a></p>

<p><strong>Industrial lifters and separators :</strong></p>

<p>Electromagnets can be used to separate ferromagnetic materials from non-magnetic materials. When the electromagnets are switched on they attract the magnetic materials but leave the non-magnetic materials behind. When the electromagnet is switched off, it releases the magnetic materials.</p>

<p>This activity will demonstrate the chemical effect of electricity. There is no need to explain the mechanism of the chemical reactions which occur.

If you want to revise what you did then, you can explain why copper forms on the negative electrode and chlorine gas forms at the positive electrode.</p>

<p>If you don't have carbon electrodes then you can strip the wood from an HB pencil. Do this carefully so that the carbon rod in the centre doesn't break. You don't have to strip all the wood off the pencil. Strip off some from the bottom to allow it to make contact with the copper sulphate solution and enough wood off the top to allow the crocodile clip to grip the carbon. The pencil carbon is not pure and so won't work quite as effectively as pure carbon electrodes.</p>

<p>To make a copper chloride solution, dissolve 15 g of copper chloride in 100 ml of warm water.</p>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>The electric current is separating the copper chloride.</p>

          
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
            
<p/>

<p>Why is it important that you do not let the carbon electrodes touch each other while the current is flowing?</p>

          
<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>It would cause a short circuit. The electrical current will then not move through the copper chloride and no separation will occur.</p>

          
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>The separation of the copper chloride means that an electric current can cause chemical reactions to occur. There are many ways in which we can harness this chemical effect for practical uses.</p>

<p><strong>Electrolysis</strong> is the breaking down of a substance into its component elements by passing an electric current through a liquid or solution. We can also use electrolysis to purify substances.</p>

<p>Impure copper can be purified using electrolysis. Instead of using carbon electrodes in a copper sulphate solution we can use copper electrodes. If one of the copper electrodes is pure copper and the other is impure copper, then the impure electrode will break down and deposit pure copper on to the already pure copper electrode.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the most important uses of electrolysis is <strong>electroplating</strong>.</p>

<p>Electrolysis is used to electroplate metals. In the last activity, one of the carbon electrodes was coated with an even layer of pure copper. We say that the carbon electrode was electroplated with copper.</p>

<p>Why do we electroplate? An example is in the making of jewellery where an inexpensive metal is made into a ring, for example, and then coated with gold by electroplating. This makes it less expensive than if it were made from pure gold. Iron rusts easily and so it is useful to coat it with a layer of a zinc to protect it from corrosion. Many car parts, bathroom taps and wheel rims are electroplated with chromium.</p>

<p>A child, while inserting an electric plug into the socket, did not see that there was a thin piece of aluminium foil stuck between the pins of the plug. When he turned the switch on, he noticed a spark at the plug, and at the same time, the lights went out. What could have happened to cause the spark and to make the lights go out? [4 marks]</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>The aluminium foil can conduct electricity. This means that a short circuit has been created. The short circuit caused a large current which would have melted a fuse and broken the electric circuit. This would have caused the electricity to switch off.</p>

<p>A circuit breaker is advantageous to use over a fuse as a fuse needs to be replaced once the metal wire melts, whereas a circuit breaker automatically detects the fault in the circuit, breaks it, and can then be reset to start operating again, either manually or automatically once the fault has been repaired.</p>
