<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>5 weeks</p>

<p>Learners are introduced to the basic concepts of ecology and the four levels in which ecological interactions are grouped for research and studying purposes. This is made explicit in the text in this introductory section and learners are given short activities to allow for meaningful engagement with these concepts. Visit <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://slidesha.re/19dpf9k">slidesha.re/19dpf9k</a>. The slides contain an overview of the concepts introduced in this section.</p>

<div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-1">What is ecology?</h2><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners have already studied the biosphere in detail in Gr. 7. They have also looked at the concept of an ecosystem in the younger grades. We will now put these different levels together in a hierarchical organisation representing the study of ecology.</p>

<p/>

<p>Every living organism on earth depends on and interacts with other living and non-living things to stay alive. Organisms depend on other organisms for food for example, and also depend on their environment for protection and a place to stay. The particular branch of Science that studies how organisms interact with other organisms and their environment is called <strong>ecology</strong>. Someone who studies these relationships and interactions is called an <strong>ecologist</strong>.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">Ecological interactions</h3>
<p/>

<p>The ecological interactions that take place within a specific area are generally classified into four levels: <strong>populations</strong>, <strong>communities</strong>, <strong>ecosystems</strong> and the <strong>biosphere</strong>.</p>

<p/>

<p>Look at the following illustration which shows the levels of organisation.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idm781840"><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0001.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>Individuals live together in <strong>populations</strong>. Different populations together make up a <strong>community</strong>. Communities together with the non-living things in their surroundings make up an <strong>ecosystem</strong>. All the ecosystems on Earth make up the <strong>biosphere</strong>.</p>

<p/>

<p>You may have heard of terms such as the biosphere and ecosystems in previous grades. What about populations and communities? You may have also heard about the population of people in South Africa, or when someone talks about your local community at home. What do we mean when we use these terms in ecology? Let's take a closer look.</p>

<p/>
<div class="section"><h4 class="title">Population</h4>
<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The website link provided in the visit box for our 'Breathing Earth' provides a very interesting simulation of how the population of the Earth, and also individual countries changes every second. If you have internet access in your classroom and a projector, you could put this website up when you first introduce population and then leave it running during the lesson. At the end of the lesson, bring it up again to see how much the Earth's population has increased in just a short time such as your lesson.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p/>

<p>In the previous illustration, we can see that the individual impala make up a population in the game reserve. On a large scale, we can also say that the 50 million people in South Africa make up our country's population.</p>

<li>Answer the questions which follow.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Discuss this with your class first and get their opinions. They should note that all the animals in a population are the same species and they can interact as they live in a specific area.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners might not know the answers to these questions as we have not yet given the definition of a population, but this is meant as a discussion and for them to come to the conclusion of what defines a population without stating the definition up front.</p>
</div><div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What do you notice about all the animals that make up a population? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>All the animals are of the same species in a population. They are different ages, there are males and females.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>In each of the photos, the populations of animals are found in a specific area. Do you think the zebra in Kruger National Park and the zebra in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi game reserve in Zululand are from the same population? Why do you say so? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>No, they are not from the same population. Individuals in a population all live in a specific area and they can interact and breed with each other. They are not able to interbreed if they live in different areas.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>How big is a population? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>A population does not have a specific size. Rather, it is defined by the area that you are talking about and whether the individuals can interact.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Do you think the seals that lived on Seal Island 100 years ago are part of the same population as the seals that live there now in the photo? Why do you say so? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>No, they are not from the same population. A population consists of organisms that live in the same space and at the same time. Individuals in a population interact with each other and are able to interbreed. Since the seals lived at different times, they cannot be part of the same population.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What do you think would happen to the population of hippos in the estuary at St Lucia if the river dried up? Explain your answer. </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The number of hippos in the population would decrease. They might not necessarily all die, but the numbers would decline. The decline may be due to some individuals of the population migrating to other areas. The population would decrease because the environment cannot support the hippos anymore as there is not enough water in their habitat. (We will look more at balance in an ecosystem later in the chapter.)</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>A group of scientists is studying a population of zebra in the Kruger National Park. They notice that over the last 4 years, the population has grown quite rapidly. Why do you think this might be the case? What are some possible reasons for this? Discuss this with your class. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Some possible reasons include: there are perhaps fewer predators and so less of the zebra are being eaten. There might perhaps be an increase in the number of females that are born and so more are reproducing. There might be an increase in the amount of food available, perhaps other populations of herbivores have decreased or there might have been particularly rainy seasons so there is lots of food (green grass). Disease may have decreased so fewer animals are dying, or the amount of hunting or poaching by humans may have decreased.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Discuss this with your learners and see what they come up with. They have looked at feeding relationships and ecosystems in previous grades and so this also links back to what they have studied before and requires them to apply what they already know to new situations.</p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p><strong>Extension question to ask your learners</strong>: Another group of scientists wants to compare the population of penguins at Boulders Beach in Cape Town with another population in Antarctica. What are some aspects of each population that they could compare?</p>

<p/>

<p>Discuss this with your learners. You can help them come to the answers by asking leading questions, such as, how would the scientists compare the habitats of the two populations? How would they compare how well the penguins are doing in each population?</p>

<p/>

<p>Answer: Some aspects that they could compare between the populations are: growth rate of the population, the number of deaths and births in a given time frame, what the penguins in each population eat, what are the natural enemies/ predators of each population of penguins, which other species do the populations of penguins interact with in their environment, how many times per year do they reproduce, do they build shelters, is there any human impact on the penguins etc.</p>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p/>

<p>A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area at a specific point in time and they can interbreed with each other. When a scientist studies a population they might study how the population grows and the factors that affect how the population increases or decreases. They will also look at how the population interacts with the environment.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Community</h4>
<p>In ecology, a community refers to all the populations of organisms that <strong>interact</strong> in a certain area. Community ecology is the study of how they interact. For example, what feeding relationships occur in the area? What types of grasses do specific herbivores eat and what eats the herbivores? Turn back to the illustration of the wildlife in the game reserve. Which animals make up the community? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Lions, wildebeest, zebra, impala and vulture.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p><strong/> This is a possible extension activity if you would like to do it with your learners. This has only been included in the Teachers Guide as many learners might not be familiar with an underwater environment.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Ecosystem</h4>
<p>Turn back to the illustration of the wildlife in a game reserve. The different populations interact with each other to form a community. When we look at how the communities interact with the non-living things in their environment, then we are looking at ecology at the ecosystem level.</p>

<p/>

<p>Think of the different populations of organisms making up a community in Kruger National Park, such as the zebra, elephant, lions, springbok, different trees and grasses. Now look at the photo of some of these populations at a watering hole. In this photo we are studying how the living things interact with the non-living things. For example, the zebra and springbok are drinking water, whilst the elephant is splashing mud over itself to cool down. This is an <strong>ecosystem</strong>.</p>

<p>All the ecosystems on Earth combined make up the biosphere. At the biosphere level, we can study how the living and non-living things interact on a much larger scale. This includes climate changes, how the Earth has changed over history and even how the movement of planet Earth affects different ecosystems, wind patterns as well as rock and soil formation.</p>

<p>The living organisms on Earth live and interact in different ecosystems around the planet. Together all these ecosystems make up the Earth's biosphere. An ecosystem consists of the <strong>abiotic</strong> (non-living) environment and the <strong>biotic</strong> (living) organisms.</p>

<p/>

<p>We have looked a lot at the living organisms in different ecosystems in the last section, but what are some of the abiotic things in ecosystems? And how do the biotic things interact with the abiotic environment in a system?</p>

<li> The worm and insect live in the soil. </li>
</ol></div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>In the picture, the blue arrows show the movement of water through the ecosystem. What do we call this movement of water? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The blue arrows describe the water cycle.</p>


<p>You can revise the water cycle here, namely: The water in the pond/dam evaporates as it changes from a liquid to a gas. The water vapour then condenses to form clouds as fine droplets of water. When the water droplets become big enough, they precipitate as rain. The water runs down the slopes and collects in the lower regions such as the pond.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Temperature is an abiotic factor in an ecosystem. What can affect the temperature in the grassland ecosystem? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The time of day will affect the temperature as this will affect how much heat energy the ecosystem receives from the Sun depending on the Earth's position. The time of year will also affect the temperature as the ecosystems distance from the sun changes. Weather conditions will also affect the temperature, for example if there are clouds, wind, or it is raining. The direction the area faces will also affect the temperature, for example if it is on a slope.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Another abiotic factor which affects ecosystems is the slope of the land. For example, is it flat or are there hills or mountains. How would you describe the land in the grassland ecosystem? How do you think this contour affects the ecosystem? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>This grassland ecosystem has a sloped surface. There is a hill on the right hand side and the ground slopes downwards towards the pond. This shape and slope enables the water to run down when it rains and collect in the pond, thereby providing a collection of water for the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Apart from the recycling water, biotic and abiotic factors also interact to recycle carbon dioxide and oxygen in ecosystems. Photosynthesis in plants uses carbon dioxide to produce glucose. The plants and animals then break down the sugars and release carbon dioxide again during respiration. Photosynthesis releases oxygen, while plants and animals take it in for respiration. Look at the following illustration which shows how the gases are cycled through a pond ecosystem.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Studying an ecosystem</h1>
<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This activity may be given to learners as a project. Learners will mark off parts of an ecosystem and must ideally be able to return to it regularly. You as the teacher must pre-visit the area and find a suitable area for marking off and studying, preferably near a stream or shore. Ensure that there is enough space for several classes to study the same area without damaging it. Identify organisms and find possible relationships between them. Show learners before the visit how to use equipment correctly and how to keep records. If you have microscopes, teach them how to use these to study soil samples and small organisms. During the visit, you will have to circulate and check on the groups of learners.</p>

<p/>

<p>As many of the measurements taken will be new concepts and practices, you should explain the reasons for measuring different environmental conditions in the ecosystem. During the investigations it is also important to walk between groups to ensure that they are applying the newly learnt skills appropriately and taking accurate measurements.</p>

<p/>

<p>The leaf litter and soil samples may be studied in the field but could also be studied in the class. If teachers have taught learners to use basic light microscopes they should encourage them to study these with the use of a microscope too.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Describe the different habitats in your ecosystem. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. They may describe the habitats/ecosystem as aquatic, terrestrial, or even a pond, grass, forest, etc.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Explain how you think the abiotic factors of the ecosystem you studied affect the plants and animals in your ecosystem. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. Learners should take note of the water resources in their square, the slope of the land, and the type of soil and how this affects the organisms.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What relationships did you notice between the plants and animals in the area you studied? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. Learners should take note of any feeding relationships that may exist. We will be studying this in more detail next, but learners would have done this in previous grades.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>In the area that you studied, was there any evidence of human interference? For example, rubbish or a pathway? How did this impact on the living organisms and also the abiotic factors in your square? What suggestions can you make to prevent this kind of interference. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. Perhaps there is litter which is blocking a stream, or that animals can eat and choke on. Perhaps there is a path that humans walk on, resulting in them trampling the plants so that nothing grows there. Learners could suggest putting some rubbish bins nearby, or perhaps mark off the area so that people have to walk around, etc.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Do you think that your presence while you made your observations had an influence on the animals or plants in the quadrant that you observed?</p>
</div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. Learners may observe that insects or other small animals scurried away from them when they approached their quadrant. or perhaps insects were drawn to the stakes and rope that was used to demarcate their area.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>You may choose to use this practical activity for learners to submit a written account/ report of their work and to present their findings to the class in the form of a powerpoint presentation. Possible areas to evaluate might include:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Title and purpose</li>
<li>Procedures followed by the group (as awarded from observations by the teacher)</li>
<li>Comparative data similarities to other groups in the class that measured in similar areas.</li>
<li>Answer to the questions above.</li>
<li>Oral presentation of their research as presented in their powerpoint slideshow to the class. They could include the different activities that will be conducted throughout this chapter, such as their work on the different food chains and the food web that exists in their marked off ecosystem and work on conservation of their marked off ecosystem.</li>

<p/>

<p>We studied relatively small ecosystems. How big can an ecosystem be? Does size in an ecosystem matter?</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Ecosystem size</h3>
<p/>

<p>The size of a real ecosystem is not defined in terms of area, but rather by the interactions that occur inside it. It can be as small as a river bank or as large as the Kruger National Park.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-6">Types of interactions</h3>
<p>Within an ecosystem the species living in a particular area can interact in different ways with each other. We can classify the interactions between organisms as follows:</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idm5477424"><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0014.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p><strong>1. Competition</strong></p>

<p>When two species in an ecosystem need to share a valuable and often limited resource. such as food or water, they are in competition with each other. The two different species compete with each other for the same resources, especially food.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0015.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalangalma/8197670802/"/><figcaption class="caption">Hyenas and vultures are both scavengers and compete for the same food. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalangalma/8197670802/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/dalangalma/8197670802/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p><strong>2 . Symbiosis</strong></p>

<p>Symbiosis describes the way in which two different species living together in the same community, interact with each other over a long time period. This can occur in the form of parasitism, mutualism or commensalism.</p>

<p/>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li><strong>Parasitism</strong>: Parasitism is when the one species benefits or gains something from the relationship and the other species is harmed in some way. The host may die in some interactions.</li>
</ul><figure><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0016.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31031835@N08/6368338667/"/><figcaption class="caption">Ticks are parasites and feed off the blood of many animals, for example dogs, cows, buck and humans. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31031835@N08/6368338667/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/31031835@N08/6368338667/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li><strong>Mutualism:</strong> Mutualism occurs between any two species where both of the individuals benefit from the interaction. Both species gain something from the other, so we can say it is mutually beneficial.</li>
</ul><figure><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0017.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dejeuxx/6924771739/"/><figcaption class="caption">Pollination is an example of mutualism as the bee gets food (nectar) from the flower and the flower is pollinated by the bee so that it can reproduce. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dejeuxx/6924771739/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/dejeuxx/6924771739/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

</div>
<p/>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li><strong>Commensalism</strong>: In some interactions between individuals from different species, the one species benefits, while the other one is unaffected by the relationship. Unlike parasitism, in commensalism the other species is not harmed or benefited in any way.</li>
</ul><figure><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0018.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcelekkel/4803634603/"/><figcaption class="caption">A whale shark with remora fish.

<p><strong>3. Feeding:</strong> Different species in an ecosystem are related and interact when one species can use the other species as a food source. For example, in predator-prey relationships, the one species (<strong>predator</strong>) will hunt another species (<strong>prey</strong>).</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0019.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomson-safaris/8377408989/"/><figcaption class="caption">Lions and zebras have a predator-prey relationship. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomson-safaris/8377408989/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/thomson-safaris/8377408989/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>In the last section we saw how organisms from different species interact within an ecosystem. Let's now take a closer look at how organisms interact through their feeding relationships.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-8">Feeding types</h3>
<p>Living organisms need to feed to be able to perform the other life processes. Some organisms can produce their own food, such as plants, while other organisms cannot do this and need to feed on other organisms to obtain their energy.</p>

<p/>

<p>We can therefore identify different feeding types in an ecosystem, based on how the organism obtains (gets) its food. There are <strong>producers</strong> and <strong>consumers</strong>.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="title">Producers</h4>
<p>Producers are organisms that are able to produce their own organic food. They do not need to eat other organisms to do this. Producers are also called <strong>autotrophs</strong>. Which organisms have you come across that can make their own food?</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The term autotroph comes from the Greek words <em>autos</em> meaning 'self' and <em>trophe</em> meaning 'nourishing'. So autotroph means 'self-feeding'.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Plants are producers because they make their own food during photosynthesis. What do plants need in order to photosynthesise? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Plants need water from the soil, carbon dioxide from the air, and sunlight energy from the sun.</p>
</div>

<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>In 2011, deep sea researchers discovered mussels living in symbiosis with bacteria that use hydrogen as a fuel source in chemosynthesis. These are the first organisms discovered to do so!</p>
</div>
<p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Consumers</h4>
<p>Organisms which cannot produce their own food need to eat other organisms to get food. These organisms are called consumers. All animals are consumers as they cannot produce their own food. Consumers are also called <strong>heterotrophs.</strong></p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The term heterotroph comes from the Greek words<em>heteros</em> meaning 'different' and <em>trophe</em> meaning 'nourishing'. So heterotroph means 'different-feeding' or feeding on different things.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>There are many types of consumers and we can classify them into specific groups depending on the food that they consume. These are:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
                <strong>herbivores</strong>
              </li>
<li>
                <strong>carnivores</strong>
              </li>
<li>
                <strong>omnivores</strong>
              </li>
<li>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What kingdom do the above organisms belong to? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>They are mushrooms so they are part of the Fungi kingdom.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What do you notice about where these mushrooms are growing? What are they mostly growing on? Is it dead or alive? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The mushrooms are mostly growing on dead plant matter, such as dead tree logs and humus.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>The mushrooms get their nutrients from what they are growing on. At the same time, they are breaking down this dead matter. What can we therefore call fungi? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>We can call them decomposers.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>When fungi, and other decomposers, break down dead material, they help to return nutrients to the soil. Write a few sentences where you explain why you think decomposers are important in an ecosystem and how they help an ecosystem to function. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Decomposers break down the matter in dead organisms to release the nutrients such as water and carbon, back into the ecosystem. These nutrients are therefore recycled and made available for other organisms to use. They also help to keep an ecosystem 'clean' as they make sure that dead and decaying material is not left lying around in an ecosystem for an extended period.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>

<p>We now know that the different organisms in an ecosystem are related by how they feed. There are producers and consumers. We have seen that organisms from one species eat other organisms from another species. How can we link these feeding relationships together to describe how the energy is transferred in an ecosystem from the producers to the consumers?</p>

<p/></div></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-9">Energy flow: Food chains and food webs</h2><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>energy pyramid</li>

<p/>

<p>The flow of energy from the sun to different organisms in an ecosystem is very important as it supports all the life process of living organisms. In this section we will look more closely at the way in which energy flows from the sun to different organisms in order to support and sustain life on Earth.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-10">Energy transfer</h3>
<p/>

<p>Energy is vital for organisms to carry out their life processes. All energy in <strong>food webs</strong> comes from the sun. Plants trap sunlight energy during photosynthesis and convert it to chemical potential energy in food compounds, which are available to animals. Herbivores get energy directly from plants, but carnivores and omnivores eat animals for energy. This energy transfer is shown by <strong>food chains</strong>.</p>

<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What can we call this diagram? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">

<p/><p>Yes, it does make a difference. The arrows show the direction in which the energy is transferred as one organism eats the other one, always from the producers to the consumers.</p>

<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. Learner's food chains must start with a green plant (producer), or part of a green plant, such as a fruit or wheat. Make sure they have used the arrows in the correct direction, and that they have three levels of consumers.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Where would you place decomposers in a food chain? Why do you say so? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. They could say that decomposers would come at the end of the food chain as they break down the bodies of the dead organisms. Or they are often put at the side, with many arrows from all levels of the food chain as they break down all the dead organisms at every level.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p/>

<p>Can you see how the above food chain describes how the energy is passed along from the producer to the consumers? But, there are three different consumers in this food chain. How can we distinguish between the different consumers?</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Animals that eat plants are <strong>primary consumers</strong>. (Primary means <em>first</em>.)</li>
<li>Animals that eat primary consumers are called <strong>secondary consumers.</strong></li>
<li>Animals that eat the secondary consumers (mostly predators) are the <strong>tertiary consumers</strong>.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Identify the different levels of consumers in the food chain in the activity.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Encourage learners to write the levels into the diagram. The grasshopper is the primary consumer, the rat is the secondary consumer and the owl is the tertiary consumer.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Each of these levels in the food chain is called a <strong>trophic level</strong>. The organism uses up to 90% of its food energy itself for its life processes. Only about 10% of the energy goes into new body cells and is available to the next animal when it gets eaten. This loss of energy at each trophic level can be shown by an <strong>energy pyramid</strong>. But, why do we show it in the shape of a pyramid? Let's find out.</p>

<p>90% of the energy is lost and only 10% is made available to the next trophic level. Why do you think this happens? Discuss this in your class and write your answer down below. </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The organisms in each level use most of the energy (\(\text{90}\)%) to sustain their own life processes (such as breathing, moving, reproducing etc). Therefore, only \(\text{10}\)% is available to the next level which feeds on them. Learners might need help with this question, so ask them leading questions such as, what do the organisms in each level need energy for?</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Give possible reasons why you think there needs to be so many producers in these ecosystems. </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Energy flow in an ecosystem is very inefficient and only \(\text{10}\)% of the energy from a trophic level is passed to the next level. Therefore, to provide enough energy for the subsequent trophic levels, there needs to be many plants as primary producers.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>How many trophic levels are there in each of the ecosystems? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>There are 5 in the marine and 3 in the savanna ecosystem.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Compare the amount of producers with the amount of secondary consumers. Why does there seem to be such a large difference in numbers? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Since only \(\text{10}\)% of the energy produced by the consumers is passed on to the next level, the primary consumers need to eat a large amount of producers to get enough energy to live. In the same way, each level needs to be supported by a larger population that it feeds on as only \(\text{10}\)% of energy is passed on to each level.</p>

<p>Consumers have different sources of food in an ecosystem and do not only rely on only one species for their food. If we put all the food chains within an ecosystem together, then we end up with many interconnected food chains. This is called a food web.

<p/>

<p>In this section will examine the balance between the different trophic levels in ecosystems, since all organisms in the ecosystem have to rely on the resources the area can supply. Any area can only support a <strong>limited</strong> number of animals. Look at the ecosystem below and decide which resources the organisms depend on. Remember to take some notes.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Use this as an entry point into this section.The resources that organisms depend on are food, shelter and water. Ask learners questions such as, what would happen if there was a drought and all the grass died, or there was a fire that swept through and burned all the plants, or what happened if all the zebra got a disease and died? The ecosystem would become imbalanced in some way.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0049.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A balanced savanna ecosystem.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>If all the grass and trees die, what would happen to the zebra and elephants? What would later happen to the cheetah and hyena? Why is this? The balance in an ecosystem refers to how many animals it can support for long periods. If the balance is upset, the whole system could fail.</p>

<p>One of the factors that we can look at within an ecosystem to see if it is balanced is the population growth of different species over time.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-13">Population growth</h3>
<p/>

<p>Over time ecological populations interact and change within a community. All populations change over time and grow. The population growth of a species in the wild is kept in balance by a number of different factors.</p>

<p/>

<p>Human intervention can sometimes cause serious damage to an animal population, such as the critically <strong>endangered</strong> Riverine Rabbit. There are fewer than 200 individuals left in South Africa. It only eats from a few plant types, so its <strong>habitat</strong> is restricted to where these plants are found, like small areas of the Karroo. During the day, it hides under bushes on the river banks, but many of its home areas have been invaded by humans or destroyed.</p>

<p>The main goal of any species is to reproduce and ensure the survival of the species.

These disruptions cause an imbalance in the ecosystem and can affect the organisms that live there as well as the ecosystem as a whole.</p>

<li>human factors.</li>
</ol><p/>

<p>We have already discussed this in some detail, but let's take a closer look.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="title">Natural factors</h4>
<p/>

<p>Natural disasters like floods or hurricanes can cause severe disruptions to ecosystems, but the ecosystems recover eventually. If the change occurs over long periods, like climate change and global warming, the damage may not be reversible. For example, there are many different theories about why the dinosaurs become <strong>extinct</strong>. One of the main theories is a sudden change in climate. This sudden change, whether it was due to a meteor striking earth or not, disrupted the balance in the ecosystems. It was to such an extent that all the dinosaurs died out.</p>

<p>In the 1980s a devastating drought and famine raged in Ethiopia and caused the death of 400 000 people. Many animals, plants and microorganisms also died and species that depend on water for their reproductive cycle, like amphibians, were particularly badly affected.</p>

<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What is a drought? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Drought is water shortage, when there is no rain for a long time.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>What is a famine? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>A famine is a scarcity of food when there is starvation.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>How do you think a drought and famine in a particular area, such as in Ethiopia are linked? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Drought makes plants die, so animals that eat them also die. This decreases food for humans, as crops and farm animals die as well.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>A famine is often accompanied by the spread of diseases amongst animals and humans. Why do you think this is so? </p><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Hungry and malnourished animals and humans are too weak to fight off disease.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Do you think the effects of a drought and famine on an ecosystem are reversible or irreversible? Give a reason for your answer. </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>It is usually reversible, but ecosystems can take a very long time to recover from severe droughts.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why is a drought more likely to cause an imbalance rather than a month which receives a lower rainfall than usual? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Droughts last much longer than just one season of low rainfall. Water resources are so low during a drought that most organisms die.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Perhaps discuss this with your learners before they write their answer down. Ecosystems are fairly robust and can cope with fluctuations in climate over the year. However, an imbalance results if the climate changes very suddenly or else changes and remains like that for a long period of time.</p>

<p>Many years ago, people like the San had little impact on their environment, as they lived in harmony with the land and only took what food they could carry. Modern man has, however, had a huge effect on nature. We clear land to build cities, roads and farms, we pollute the environment and produce waste and litter. Humans also poach endangered animals and over-harvest marine animals, causing lasting damage to ecosystems.</p>

<p/>

                      
<p>Illegal hunting (poaching) of animals and the killing of wild animals for 'bush meat' in many parts of Southern Africa is of serious concern to environmentalists and is driving some species close to extinction. Poor communities often rely on small wild animals they can trap for food, but removing too many of the smaller animals could force the carnivores (like lions, leopards and wild dogs) that eat them to turn to domestic animals like sheep or cattle for food. For this reason, farmers may go out and shoot even more of them. The carnivores themselves sometimes get caught in the traps. Although hunting and finding bushmeat have been traditional ways of getting food for many generations, the current 'over-hunting' is causing concern. Dr Rene Czudec of FAO commented: "There is an urgent need to look for solutions to ensure the sustainable use of SA's wildlife, while still helping to develop poor communities"</p></td></tr></table><p/>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">How did the hunting of the San differ from today's removal of bush meat?</div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The San only took what they needed, their traps were well set and their numbers were small. Today's people set traps badly, so the wrong animals are killed and then often not eaten. There are also a lot more people doing it now.</p>

<p>Why do you think there is a market for bushmeat (people who buy the bushmeat)? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">

<p>A very important note about this section is to point out the misconception that organisms adapt. This is incorrect as individual organisms do not adapt, it is the populations or species which adapt over time. Individual organisms have adaptations which make them better suited to their environment. The points in CAPS are a misconception and should be reworded as follows:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Adaptation is the change in structural, functional and behavioural characteristics of organisms in a species. Adaptation usually takes place over many generations.</li>
<li>Adaptation, over time, allows a species to survive in response to changing conditions in the environment</li>
<li>Species that are unable to adapt to changes within the environment die out (become extinct)</li>
</ul><p>Be sure to make it clear that it is <strong>species or populations of organisms</strong> that adapt, and not individual organisms.</p>

<p/>

<p>Organisms in ecosystems face competition, predation, parasitism and human influence, all of which could affect them negatively, forcing them to <strong>adapt</strong>, move away or die. It is well known that SA has undergone big climatic changes in the past. For example, the dry Karoo was once swampy and the Cango Caves in Oudtshoorn were once under water.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0058.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Rock formations inside the Cango Caves show that they were once under water.</figcaption></figure><p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Cango is a KhoiSan word and means 'Place of deep water'.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-16">What is adaptation?</h3>
<p/>

<p>When Southern Africa rose out of the sea millions of years ago, organisms that could not adapt to the new, drier <strong>terrestrial environment</strong> became extinct, but individuals that could adapt, survived and formed new populations. These adaptations could be changes in the organism's structure, function or behaviour over very long time periods. Only populations of organisms that happen to have suitable characteristics are able to survive in changing conditions within an environment. They are 'selected by nature' to survive. Those species that do not adapt will die out and become extinct.</p>

<p/>

<p>As we have said, adaptation in species can occur in three main ways:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Structural: the physical characteristics of a species such as having long legs and strong muscles.</li>
<li>Functional: a species may have special way of carrying out its life processes such as being able to produce eggs with a hard shell , so that the embryos can grow and hatch even if the climate changes.</li>
<li>Behavioural: the species can have special behaviours that are instinctive (which they know by <strong>instinct</strong>) or can be learned such as making safe nests for protecting their babies</li>
</ol><p/>

<p>These changes take place over a long time period within a species and must be passed on from generation to generation. Over time and over many generations, these adaptations in the individual organisms will allow the species to evolve and adapt to its changing environment. Let's have a look at some of the adaptations of plants and animals.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-17">Adaptations in animals</h3>

<p/>

<p>Several local plants are also adapted to their environment.</p>

<p/>

<p>The umbrella thorn in the African savannah can survive temperatures ranging from 50&#176;C to below freezing. Its deep roots reach ground water easily and the small leaves prevent dehydration, while still being well exposed to light due to the umbrella shape of the tree. Why does it need light? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The more exposure to sunlight, the higher the rate of photosynthesis. Encourage your learners to take notes when you discuss topics in class.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0069.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An umbrella thorn acacia.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>The Baobab tree survives in dry areas, since it stores water in the thick trunk and spongy wood. The smooth bark reflects heat, making it cooler, but also helps protect the fruits from monkeys. How can it do this?</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why do you think these plants are commonly referred to as 'living stones' or 'pebble plants'? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>This is because they are plants but they are camouflaged to look like stones or pebbles.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Why do you think the plants have such different patterns on their surfaces? How does this help them to survive in their environment? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The <em>Lithops</em> plants are camouflaged to look like stones and blend in with their rocky soil that they grow in. The patterns look like different rocks/pebbles. They are therefore not usually seen by herbivores which might eat them. This adaptation protects them from being eaten.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p><em>Lithops</em> plants are classified as succulents. What does this mean? What type of environment are succulents adapted to live in? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Succulents are plants which are adapted to live in hot, arid environments and they have thickened, fleshy leaves and stems to store water.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p><em>Lithops</em> leaves are fleshy and mainly underground, and the stem is short. Flowers grow between the leaves, which shrink to below ground level during drought. How does this help the plant survive? </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The fact that the leaves are mostly underground helps the plant to conserve water because as little as possible is exposed to the hot environment so this reduces water loss. During drought, the leaves shrink even further underground to try to conserve water even more.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>If the leaves are reddish-brown and mainly underground, where is the chlorophyll? Examine these dug-up stone plants.</p>

<p>The labelled micrograph should look something like this:</p>

          <figure id="gd-idm3349856"><img src="images/gr8ll02-gd-0080.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>The upper patterned surface acts as a window. Can you see the clear, fleshy middle parts of the leaves? Do you think light can travel through this? How does this allow the plant to photosynthesise? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The upper part of the leaves acts as window and lets light through. As the interior of the leaves is transparent, the sunlight can travel through to the bottom parts of the leaves which are underground and contain the chlorophyll in order to photosynthesise. This allows the plant to have a coloured, patterned upper surface to camouflage it from herbivores, but still allows that sunlight to travel through for photosynthesis.</p>

<p/>

<p>Our country is one of the most naturally diverse in the world. This means that we have many different species and habitats and ecosystems here, more than most other places in the world.</p>

<p/>

<p>Our country's natural beauty and diversity attract thousands of tourists each year, but it is under severe threat from poaching, pollution and other human influence. Ecosystems are able to naturally recycle materials like water, carbon dioxide and other gases and the remains of organisms, if they are left alone. But ecosystems cannot do this effectively if we interfere. These human interferences include:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Habitat destruction like deforestation and burning</li>
<li>Pollution causing global warming</li>
<li>Alien invasive plants taking over ecosystems</li>
<li>Hunting, poaching and other killing of wildlife</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>These pressures have caused great loss in biodiversity. Some ecosystems are under strain and others have already collapsed.</p>

<p/>

<div class="note col-md-10" data-type="keyconcepts">

<p><strong>Ecosystems</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Ecology is the study of interactions of organisms with one another and with the physical and chemical environment.</li>
<li>The study of ecological interactions is conducted at four levels:
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>populations</li>
<li>communities</li>
<li>ecosystems</li>
<li>biosphere(s)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All ecosystems combined make up the biosphere.</li>
<li>An ecosystem consists of a community that includes all living organisms (biotic) such as plants and animals, together with the non-living (abiotic) environment and climatic conditions such as temperature, air and wind, water, interacting as a system.</li>
<li>An ecosystem can refer to a specific area on Earth or the entire biosphere can be regarded as one large ecosystem.</li>
<li>The survival of populations and species depends on whether enough individuals are suited to the environmental conditions at the time. As conditions do change over time only those better suited to the changed environment will be able to continue the species. And so over time species adapt.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p><strong>Feeding relationships</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>Plants are <em>producers</em>. They make their own food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animals are <em>consumers</em>. They obtain food from plants either directly (such as herbivores) or indirectly (such as carnivores).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Herbivores</em> feed on plants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Carnivores</em> feed on other animals (living or dead). This group includes:</p>

            <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li><em>Predators</em> hunt other animals, their <em>prey</em>, for example lions and leopards.</li>
<li><em>Scavengers</em> that eat dead animals, for example hyenas and vultures.</li>
<li><em>Insectivores</em> that eat insects and other small invertebrates such as worms</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Omnivores</em> feed on plants and animals. Humans are generally omnivores.</li>
<li><em>Decomposers</em> break down (decompose) the remains of dead plants and animals. They recycle important nutrients in the environment.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p><strong>Energy flow: food chains and food webs</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Plants and some algae play a very important role in the ecosystem because they capture the radiant energy from the Sun and use it in the process of photosynthesis to produce glucose that the plant and other animals can use to gain energy.</li>
<li>This energy is passed along a food chain from producers to consumers; decomposers are the last link in this transfer of energy. They release energy as heat to the environment.</li>
<li>Each stage of a food chain is called a <em>trophic level</em>.</li>
<li>Energy transfer and energy loss occur at each trophic level.</li>
<li>Interlinked food chains together form food webs.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p><strong>Balance in an ecosystem</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>An ecosystem can only accommodate as many organisms as its resources (food, water and shelter) can carry.</li>
<li>The balance can be disturbed by natural or human factors:
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>natural factors include extreme changes in patterns of weather and climate, such as floods, drought, extreme and sudden changes in temperature.</li>
<li>human factors include removing organisms from the ecosystem (such as poaching), human-induced pollution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These factors can contribute to an imbalance in an ecosystem, seriously impacting on its components and altering its nature.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p><strong>Adaptations</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Adaptation is the change in the structural, functional or behavioural characteristics of a species over many generations.</li>
<li>Adaptation allows the species to survive as it adapts to changing conditions within the environment.</li>
<li>Species and populations of organisms that are unable to adapt to changes in the environment will die out and become extinct.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p><strong>Conservations of ecosystems</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>People can work towards managing and sustaining natural ecosystems.</li>
<li>Individuals can contribute to conservation in various ways such as appropriate waste disposal (including recycling and reusing).</li>
</ul><p/>

<p><strong>Concept map</strong></p>

<p>This concept map shows how the concepts in this chapter on the 'Interactions and interdependence within the environment' link together. Complete the concept map by filling in the 2 levels which are missing for the study of ecology. Also, fill in the 4 types of consumers that you have learned about in this chapter.</p>

<p>Teacher's version</p>

<p>Remember that concept maps are different to mind maps in that concept maps have a hierarchical structure and show how concepts link together using arrows and linking words. Whereas mindmaps generally contain a central topic and individual branches coming out which do not necessarily link together. Mindmaps can also be a useful way of summarizing information and studying, however, we are using concept maps as they help to show linkages, which is very important in science. Help your learners to 'read' the concept map by showing them that the arrows show the direction in which concepts progress and are linked to each other. Learners might battle to find the other 2 levels in which we study ecology - help them by reminding them of the 4 levels, namely; populations, communities, ecosystems and the biosphere.</p>

<p/><p>Producers: are organisms / plants that are able to produce their own energy from sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and do not need to consume other organisms to get energy.</p>

<p>Tertiary Consumers: consumers secondary consumers to get energy.</p>

        
<p>The trophic levels can be represented as a pyramid as there needs to be more organisms in the bottom layer than in the layer above it.

<p>There are more zebra than cheetah in this balanced ecosystem. Explain why this is so. [3 marks] </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The zebra are primary consumers and use about \(\text{90}\)% of the energy that they get from the grass, transferring about \(\text{10}\)% to the cheetah to consume. There therefore needs to be more zebra than cheetah in order to make sure the cheetah are supported in terms of food supply, and also that they do not eat all the zebra so that the zebra population does not die out.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Describe the work of the producers in this ecosystem. [2 marks] </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The producers capture the energy from the sunlight and convert it to chemical potential energy in the form of glucose through the process of photosynthesis. In this way they place energy into the ecosystem which animals cannot do.</p>

<p>What do you think would happen to this ecosystem if all the zebra got a disease and died? [2 marks] </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>If all the zebra died, the ecosystem would become unbalanced. Firstly, the cheetah would not have a food source anymore and they would also in turn suffer and starve. The hyena would also have a depleted food source. There might perhaps be less dung for the dung beetle to use to lay its eggs. The grazing of the zebra also has an effect on the plants and so if the zebra all die out, the grass growth will increase.</p>

<p>What do you think would happen to this ecosystem in the short term and in the long term if a big fire came through and burned most of the grass and some of the trees? [2 marks] </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>In the short term, many of the animals would battle as the zebra and the elephant would have a reduced food source, especially the zebra which eat grass. Some of them might die. This in turn will affect the other predators. Many of the smaller organisms would also be burned. However, in the long term, this imbalance will normally be restored as the landscape recovers and the plants start to grow again after the first rains.</p>

Their back legs have fine control of the dung ball.</p></td></tr></table><p/>

<p>Read this paragraph about the Quiver tree of the Kalahari and Namib desert.</p>

        
<p>The Quiver tree lives in the Namib and Kalahari deserts, where the heat and lack of water makes it extremely difficult for plants to grow and survive. It stores its water inside green succulent leaves and bloated branches. The San used to hollow out the branches and use them for their quivers, which is where the tree gets its name from. The branches are covered with a white powder that reflects the heat and the leaves have very few pores to minimise water loss through evaporation. During extremely harsh weather conditions, the tree can amputate (remove) its own branches and reduce the leaves to minimise water loss even further, then when the conditions improve, it sends out new shoots and grows a rich leafy top again.</p>

<p/><p>The quiver tree has thick bloated branches and succulent leaves so that it can store water for the dry months. Its branches are covered in white powder to reflect heat away from plant which helps to reduce water loss. The leaves have few pores to also minimise loss of water. The tree can amputate leaves and branches if water is scarce.</p>

<p>A group of poachers recently made the following statement when they were arrested: ""<em>Why is it so important to conserve the biodiversity and the environment? Surely there are enough wild animals and plants that it doesn't matter if some of them die and become extinct?</em>" Write 3 - 4 sentences to explain to them why we need to care about the biodiversity in our country.
