<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>As an introduction, refer learners to the classification of living organisms that they would have done in Gr. 7 Life and Living. They should be familiar with the range of living organisms classified into the five kingdoms, namely plants, animals, bacteria, protists and fungi. Ask learners to explain what they understand about bacteria, protists and fungi. In previous chapters and grades, we have dealt extensively with organisms from the two kingdoms plants and animals. However, those that are not seen at a macroscopic level have not yet been studied in much detail. A more in-depth look at microorganisms is the focus of this chapter. In addition we will look at which of these are harmful and which are useful.  Learners have not yet been introduced to cells (which will follow in Gr. 9) so the classification should not go to cellular level. An excellent resource for teachers to use is: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/13Q3DrA">bit.ly/13Q3DrA</a> where Interactive 
Whiteboard lessons, videos, worksheets, etc. on microorganisms are available.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although CAPS spells 'micro-organisms' with a hyphen, which is accepted, it is not the most commonly used spelling. We have therefore used the spelling without the hyphen, namely 'microorganism' as this is what learners will mostly encounter in other resources, especially online.</p>

<p>Microorganisms have been on Earth for billions of years and have adapted to live in extreme conditions. They are found in almost all areas of the Earth's biosphere and new microorganisms are still being discovered all the time. Some can be harmful, causing disease and illnesses, while others are useful to us and are a vital part of ecosystems. Let's take a closer look!</p>

<p>The prefix 'micro' comes from the Greek word <em>mikros</em> meaning small. How many words can you think of which contain the prefix micro? What do they all have in common?</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Microorganisms are extremely small living organisms. People did not even know they existed until the invention of microscopes in the 1600s! We say that we cannot see microorganisms with the 'naked eye'. We have to view them under a microscope.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">What does 'microscopic' mean?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The intention of this short activity is to familiarise learners with the idea of microscopic objects and what this means. To be microscopic means that they need to be viewed under a microscope. The purpose is to show learners that many objects can be viewed under a microscope to see the detail, and there are many objects which can only be viewed under a microscope in order to be seen at all.</p>

<p>The following images show different views of the same object. One image shows what we would see with our naked eye. We call this the <strong>macroscopic</strong> view. The other photo shows what we would see if we viewed the object under a microscope. This is called the <strong>microscopic</strong> view. For each object, identify which is the microscopic view and which is the macroscopic view.</p>

<p>In the last activity we saw that you can view objects under a microscope allowing you to see much more detail than if you just viewed them with your naked eyes. There are many organisms on Earth however, which we cannot see at all with our naked eye. We can only see them when we look under a microscope. These are <strong>microorganisms</strong>.</p>

<p/>

<p>The living organisms on Earth can be grouped in many ways. You have learnt about classification before. Let's revise our classification system for all organisms on Earth.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Classifying organisms</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is optional revision of what learners have already covered in Gr. 7 on Biodiversity, and briefly mentioned in Chapter 2 this term.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Do you think microorganisms are living or non-living? Give a reason for your answer. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>They are living. They perform all seven life processes (moving, respiring, sensing, growing, reproducing, excreting, feeding).</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>As discussed in this chapter, viruses are also microorganisms. There is much debate as to whether viruses are living or non-living. Viruses do not perform all seven life processes so they are not included in one of the five kingdoms.</p>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p/>

<p>Microorganisms include <strong>viruses</strong>, bacteria, <strong>protists</strong> and some types of <strong>fungi</strong> (although many fungi can be seen without the use of a microscope). Let's have a closer look at the different types of microorganisms, before looking at how they can impact our lives in a positive or negative way.</p>

<p/>

<p>Bacteria are a large kingdom of microorganisms. Many bacteria are responsible for causing diseases in humans, however some are also useful as we will see later. Viruses are also tiny organisms, much smaller than bacteria even. They can <strong>infect</strong> all types of organisms, such as plants, animals and also bacteria. Viruses need to infect other organisms in order to replicate (reproduce).</p>

<p>Fungi are also one of the five kingdoms of organisms. Many different varieties of fungi exist. Some are large enough for us to see without the help of a microscope, like mushrooms and bread mould. They are macroscopic. There are others which are microscopic and can only be seen under a microscope, for example yeast.</p>

<p>Protists are a very diverse group of microorganisms. The organisms in this kingdom do not fit easily into any of the other four kingdoms, namely animals, plants, fungi or bacteria. However, some protists are plant-like and others are animal-like. Most protists are microscopic and live in water. The only macroscopic members are the algae or seaweeds.</p>

<p/>

<p>How do you know the size of a microorganism? You will notice that many pictures of microorganisms have a <strong>scale bar</strong>. A scale bar is a very useful tool that allows us to calculate the actual size of objects. Follow the instructions below to figure out the length of this <em>Oxytricha trifallax</em> protist<em>.</em></p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Microorganisms that cause disease are found on many surfaces which come into contact with humans regularly, such as handrails, public keypads, etc. They are also found in places which are unclean.

<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Transmission of infectious diseases</h3>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>These diseases are called <strong>infectious</strong> diseases as they can be passed from one organisms to the next.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We can come into contact with various dangerous microorganisms each and every day, whether it is when you open the door handle of a toilet or use a trolley at the shopping centre. Pathogens can spread between humans and other organisms in many different ways, for example:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p><strong>In droplets from the air that we breathe:</strong> When an infected person sneezes or coughs, the pathogen travels in the drops of spit or mucus to another person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In untreated and contaminated water:</strong> The pathogen is <strong>transmitted</strong> in <strong>contaminated</strong> water, especially if it has been in contact with human sewage. These diseases are called waterborne diseases, such as cholera and typhoid, and cause diarrhoea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In contaminated food:</strong> Sometimes people prepare food without washing and disinfecting their hands properly and the food can become contaminated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Through cuts or wounds:</strong> Many pathogens enter our bodies via cuts or wounds. For example, tetanus bacteria live in the soil and when someone hurts themselves on a piece of rusty metal, this pathogen can infect the person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Through bites from animals:</strong> Some pathogens can spread via bites from infected animals. For example, the rabies virus from infected animals and malaria is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.</p>
</li>
</ol><p/>

<p>One of the best ways to prevent the spread of harmful pathogens is by washing your hands regularly with soap and warm water.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">How easily do viruses spread?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is an<strong>optional</strong> activity, but it is suggested if you have time in class.</p>

<p/>

<p>This activity develops from the previous text about the spread of diseases. We will be looking at how viruses spread, and in particular sexually transmitted diseases (STD's). The aim of this activity is to open up discussion about choices of protection to prevent STD's, and importantly the freedom to say "no" and mean "no". Once the activity is completed it is very important to have a detailed discussion about the wider issues involved and the importance of learners having a clear concept of what they want before embarking in sexual activity. It provides the opportunity to discuss the issues and realities of both STD's and preventing unwanted pregnancies.</p>

<p/>

<p>Birth control or contraception are methods or devices used to prevent pregnancy. However, some contraceptives (pills) may not prevent STDs, whereas some (condoms) may also PROTECT individuals from contracting STDs.</p>

<p/>

<p>You are using acid to track the spread of STD's - the acid represents a microorganism that causes an STD. One person will be passing acid in the form of vinegar, as the children share their water. The water should be shared by pouring water into each other's cups, not by drinking! If they have been acidified they will pass the acid on to whoever they share their water with. By the end of the activity only those who do not accept from others will remain "disease free". This can either be related to abstinence, or could equally represent people who had safe sex and used protection to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids that may contain the microorganisms which cause STDs.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We are going to have a look at how some viruses spread by acting it out.</p>

</ol><p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p><strong>Instructions for the activity:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Divide the class into three groups: A, B and C. Each group will be given different instructions to carry out.</li>
<li>Brief each of the groups in private as follows (the other groups must not be able to hear the instructions given):
<p/>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p><strong>Group A</strong>: Instruct them that no matter who offers to share their water with them, they must be very firm and polite but say<strong> "No".</strong> However, they should offer their water to people they want to give some to. They must NOT let anyone give them water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Group B</strong>: Instruct them they can share their water with whoever they want and they can choose if they wish to receive water from other members of the class. They can say <strong>yes or no</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Group C</strong>: Instruct them that if anybody offers them water they should say<strong> "Yes".</strong> They must also try very hard to give a little of their 
water to as many people as they can. They 
must try to convince those that say no they should have some. (They are not allowed to give water if the person is definite about "no".)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All groups should be encouraged to try to share a little water with as many people as they can but if someone is very firm about "no" they have to respect this.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You (the teacher) must also take part in the activity. Your cup must have acidified water (vinegar) in it. Make sure you get as many pupils as possible to have some, or target pupils you know have strong persuasive skills.</li>
<li>Once everyone has their instructions and a cup of water, go outside or in an open space to perform the activity.</li>
<li>Allow everyone to sensibly walk round, mingling all groups, offering to share their water.</li>
<li>After about 10 minutes ask the groups to gather into their designated groups A, B or C again.         Place the cups in groups (A, B, C) on a table keeping the groups separate.</li>
<li>Now carefully add a few drops of indicator to every person's cup.</li>
<li>Get your class to observe patterns in colour and discuss what each group's secret instructions were.</li>
<li>What you should find is all those in group A should turn green if you used universal indicator. (If someone was persuaded to share you may have the odd red cup, this is really useful because it shows even more clearly the power of NO). Group B will have a mix of red and green liquid in cups depending if they said yes to some or no to everybody. All of group C should be red, i.e. contaminated with acid.</li>
</ol></div>
<p/>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>At this point, discuss what the different colours mean. You can use the following questions to guide the discussion, or else learners can answer them by themselves or in small groups.</p>

<p/>

<p>Point out that only one person had the disease to start with but now everyone who has red liquid in their cup has it. Encourage discussion about how even your best friend may have slept with someone else and thus could pass the disease on to you. Therefore the only safe way to prevent getting a STD is to abstain from sexual intercourse or from the use of male condoms and female condoms. It is useful to stress that girls have as much, if not even more right, to protect themselves from disease and pregnancy, and that it should be their choice as well, which must be equally respected.</p>

<p/>

<p>You will get a lot of laughter but it is a really dynamic way to generate discussion around this very important topic. Stress the importance of each person's right to choose whether they do or don't want to take part in sex at school age. Stress the benefits of waiting but also balance it with the sensible option of protected sex not just to prevent pregnancy. It is also important to stress that even if a girl is on contraception pills, these will not provide protection against STD's - only a condom will do this.</p>

<p>As we saw, the spread of HIV can be prevented by abstinence and having protected sex. HIV can also spread if one uses an infected needle, for example. This is why it is very important that doctors always use sterilised needles and equipment in their practise. Other diseases spread in different ways.</p>

<p>The Anopheles mosquitoes that cause malaria have their abdomens pointing up, whereas normal mosquitoes have their abdomens pointing down?</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Malaria is a disease caused by a protist. The protist enters the human body via the bloodstream when an infected female Anopheles mosquito bites a person. The protist travels to the liver of the person and starts to reproduce. Malaria causes high fever and severe headaches, and can lead to a coma and death.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>There are various ways to prevent malaria. Several different medicines are available which can be taken before going to a high-risk area, which prevents someone from contracting the disease. One way to prevent the spread is to also minimise the bites that you are likely to get by using mosquito repellents and sleeping underneath mosquito nets at night. Another method is to actually eradicate the infected mosquitoes, for example by spraying breeding grounds. You can also regularly empty out containers that could could collect rain water and allow mosquitoes to breed.</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The symptoms of these diseases include coughing and sneezing. So, when an infected person coughs or speaks, they spray out drops which can carry the microorganisms and spread them to another person. the infected person could wipe their mouth or eyes and then wipe another surface, thus also spreading the disease. Ways to prevent the spread are to cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing, washing your hands, and there are also various vaccinations available to prevent one from getting these diseases.</p>

<p>Typhoid is a disease caused by a bacterial infection. Some people can have these bacteria inside their bodies without realising it, and without ever getting ill from it. They are called 'carriers'. This was the case with Mary Mallon or Typhoid Mary who was a carrier of the disease.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Research typhoid. Find out what causes the disease and what its symptoms are, and find out about treatment. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learners should include: typhoid is generally spread through food and water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person, that contains <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria. It is a life-threatening illness that causes high fevers, weakness, stomach pains and headaches, and a loss of appetite; with a red rash in some patients. The only way to know for sure whether someone has typhoid is to test their blood or faeces for the bacteria <em>Salmonella typhi</em>. Typhoid is treated with antibiotics and there is a vaccine against it.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>Typhoid Mary</strong></p>

<p>Mary Mallon emigrated from Ireland to America at the age of 15.  When she arrived she became a servant, and soon discovered a talent for cooking. Since the cook in households earned a higher salary, she was happy to change from a simple servant to this role. She worked in 8 households from 1900-1907 as the cook, leaving a trail of 51 people seriously ill with typhoid, one of whom, a small girl, died of the disease.</p>

<p/>

<p>When she was eventually identified as the cause of the many illnesses, authorities at first tried to persuade her to volunteer samples of her faeces, blood and urine to be tested. She refused, although she did admit that she seldom washed her hands when working with food. She didn't think it was necessary. Eventually, after putting up a tremendous fight, she was taken with the help of 5 policemen, to the nearby hospital where the samples were removed. These proved that she was in fact infected with typhoid although she was not sick at all. The authorities sent her to a small island near the city where she was kept away from others for fear of infecting them too. Apart from a short 'parole period', she remained on this island, in full health, until her death.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Why do you think the newspaper article from more than 100 years ago shows Mary breaking skulls into a frying pan? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>They were showing how each time she made a meal she was transmitting typhoid to the family and people who would eat the food, and could potentially die from the disease.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Explain how you think the disease was most probably spread from Mary to the people in the home where she worked? Tip: We know that handwashing was not a common practice at this time. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>She might not have washed her hands after going to the toilet and might in this way have spread the disease to the food she was preparing. The people eating the food would then have contracted the illness.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Do you think Mary believed the accusations against her? What could have been her reasons for this? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer but could include: No, she did not show any symptoms so she probably thought that they were accusing her of something that was not true. Yes, she did because she saw so many people getting sick around her but she was afraid to admit it.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Imagine being Mary and refusing to give authorities samples of your faeces, urine and blood. Why would you not want to give these? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>If she did not believe the accusations then she probably thought that they were on a witchhunt and wanted to make her look guilty, so she refused. If she thought that she was in fact making people sick she might have been really scared that the truth would come out and she would have caused all the people to be sick. Either way she knew that they would use the results to take action against her, banishing her to a quarantine colony.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Do you think authorities acted against Mary's basic human rights? Explain your answer. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Yes and no. Yes they could have taken more care in explaining the dangers and getting her to understand the problem of her 'carrier status' (she carried the disease without getting sick), and No, she was infecting many others and making them sick so they were right to protect these people. The authorities had to weigh up Mary's basic right to privacy against those of all the other people who could potentially be harmed by her.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">If you were the doctor in charge of the investigation against Mary, how would you have acted in the same situation? Explain why you would have done this. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer.</p>

          
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This question was included to allow learners to think how they would have managed the situation differently and requires them to think about the ethical issues of the case.</p>

<p>Many scientists around the world are continually doing research to find and develop cures or vaccinations for infectious diseases, as well as ways to prevent the spread and transmission. One of the most important scientists in medical microbiology was Louis Pasteur. He was a French chemist and microbiologist. He discovered a way to reduce death rate in many diseases and also created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax.</p>

<p>In Chapter 2 we looked at the interactions and interdependence of organisms within an ecosystem. Do you remember discussing food chains and decomposers? What was the role of decomposers in the environment? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Decomposers break down dead, organic matter so that it does not clutter up an ecosystem and cause diseases, and in the process they recycle (return) nutrients to the ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Many decomposers are microorganisms. These microorganisms play a very important role in ecosystems as they break down dead plant and animal matter. They help to return the nutrients to the soil so that they are recycled. Some bacteria remove <strong>nitrogen</strong> (N<sub>2</sub>) from the air and convert it to nitrogen compounds that animals and plants can use. In plants such as<strong> legumes</strong>, the roots actually contain nodules with the bacteria inside of them. These nitrogen-fixing bacteria, called Rhizobia, cannot live independently and need a plant host. The bacteria get glucose from the plant and the plant benefits by getting the nitrogen compounds which the bacteria <strong>fixed</strong> from the soil. What is this kind of symbiotic relationship called? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>It is a mutualistic symbiotic relationship as both organisms benefit from the relationship. This links back to what learners covered in Chapter 2 and acts as a revision. Learners must be encouraged to take notes in class for these kinds of discussions.</p>

<p>We also have bacteria which live inside of us and help the functioning of our bodies! <em>Escherichia coli</em> is found in the lower intestine of many warm-blooded animals. They are part of the natural flora of the gut. They can actually help the animal by producing vitamin K<sub>2</sub> and also help prevent other harmful bacteria from growing in the gut.</p>

<p>Humans have also found ways to use microorganisms to do things for us. This dates back throughout our history. Let's find out!</p>

<p/>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Microorganisms used by people</h3>
<p/>

<p>You might be surprised at how many of our day to day experiences are somehow due to microorganisms.</p>

<p/>

<p>Have you ever seen the side of a yoghurt container which says it contains 'live cultures'? This refers to the bacteria inside the yoghurt. People use microorganisms for processing foods, such as when brewing beer, making wine, baking bread and pickling food. Microorganisms are also used in the <strong>fermentation</strong> process when producing dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese.</p>

<p/>

<p>Yeast is one of the microorganisms humans have used for food-processing. The most common uses of yeast are in producing alcoholic beverages, such as beer and wine, and in baking, as yeast is used to make dough rise.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The first records of using of yeast to make bread dates back to Ancient Egypt.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Yeast grows under specific conditions. As it grows it uses sugar for energy and converts it into carbon dioxide and alcohol. This process is called fermentation. We can measure the amount of carbon dioxide that is produced to see how well the process works.</p>

<p/>

<p>What are the best conditions for this to take place? Is there an optimal amount of sugar and what about the best temperature? These are all questions which curious people have asked over time! Let's do an investigation to find out.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We will look more at fermentation next term in Matter and Materials when we do chemical reactions.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Investigating the growth of yeast</h1>
<p/>

<p>You will conduct two separate investigations to determine the optimal conditions for yeast to grow. The first will measure what sugar concentrations are necessary for yeast to grow best. You will receive some guidance and help with this part. The second part will require that you set up your own investigation to determine at what temperature the yeast will grow best. You will be required to plan, conduct and collect data from the investigation on your own.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners will investigate the conditions necessary for optimal yeast growth or fermentation. As learners have been exposed to similar investigations in this strand it is less guided as previous investigations.</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>This investigation should run over two periods. There should be at least 2 / 3 days between these periods.</li>
<li>The investigation will be done according to the scientific method</li>
<li>The activity works well with packets of dry yeast that are readily available from supermarkets.</li>
<li>The first part of the investigation will determine the sugar concentration needed for the yeast to grow and learners will receive more guidance.</li>
<li>The second part will require learners to plan and execute their own investigation to determine the optimal temperature at which the yeast will grow.</li>
<li>Teachers may therefore choose to use this for an informal practical assessment mark.</li>
<li>This lesson may be used for a cooperative learning task where the two pairs of learners within the team of 4 could be tasked to work independently to complete different tasks and complete the mass and volume measurements. Teachers should if possible encourage this as it also minimises the use of apparatus and scales.</li>
<li>If overflow pans are not available you can also use cake pans or foil pans that are readily available from supermarkets.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Before the investigation it might help learners to watch<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLG_bsJseCU"/><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/11OzWcR">bit.ly/11OzWcR</a> to see what happens when yeast and sugar are mixed.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>Part 1: Yeast growth in different sugar concentrations</strong></p>

<p/>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong> </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>To determine the effect of different concentrations of sugar on the rate at which yeast grows.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>INVESTIGATIVE QUESTION:</strong> </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Which concentration of sugar is best for yeast growth?</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS: </strong></p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">

<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>There are different kinds of yeasts. The one we are using breaks down sugar in dough. Others break down wood and corn stalks and produce ethanol (alcohol) while another breaks down the sugar in fruits, nectar, molasses or sorghum.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Work in groups of four.</li>
<li>Use the permanent marker to label each balloon A, B, C, D, E and F.</li>
<li>Each balloon will need to be filled with 2 g of yeast and a different quantity of sugar. Balloon A will need to get 2 g of sugar, B will get 3 g of sugar, C will get 4 g of sugar and so on. (See the table below.) Use a plastic spoon or spatula to place the yeast and sugar into the balloon.</li>
<li>Use a funnel and pour 50 ml lukewarm tap water into each balloon.</li>
<li>One person should hold the balloon and funnel while the other pours in the water.</li>
<li>As soon as the balloon has been filled, take a piece of string and tie off the balloon as close as possible to the level of the water without trapping any air.</li>
<li>Knot the balloon's rubber neck to ensure that no air can get in or water can get out.</li>
<li>Place each prepared balloon on ice to prevent the fermentation process from starting.</li>
<li>Before you allow the fermentation process to start, you need to determine the starting mass and volume of each balloon.</li>
<li>MASS: Determine the mass of the tied balloon to the nearest 2 decimal places. Return it to the ice.</li>
<li>VOLUME: Use the water displacement method to determine the volume of the balloon.
<p/>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Place water in a large jug level with the top of the jug.</li>
<li>Completely submerge the balloon under the water in the jug: push the balloon and allow the water to flow over the sides into the overflow pan. You should stop when your fingers touch the water.</li>
<li>The water in the overflow plan is therefore the volume of water that the balloon displaced.</li>
<li>Carefully measure the water in the overflow pan. Record your measurements in the table below.</li>
<li>Return the balloon to the ice as soon as possible.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>PREPARE FOAM COOLER BOX: You are going to place the balloons inside a foam cooler box with warm water in (the box should keep the water warm). Pour 40 oC water into the cooler box (as it normally cools down quite quickly).</p>
</li>
<li>FERMENTATION INCUBATION: You are now ready to start the process of incubating the yeast.
<p/>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Place each balloon into the warm water.</li>
<li>Record which balloons sink and which float.</li>
<li>Leave the balloons in the warm water for 20 - 30 minutes during which time the yeast will ferment the sugar.</li>
<li>Record the exact time that you used for incubation: _____ minutes.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>AFTER INCUBATION: Use a paper towel to dry the balloons.
<p/>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Determine the volume of each balloon.</li>
<li>Determine the mass of each balloon.</li>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Describe the changes that you observed happening in your balloons from the start to the end of the incubation period. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The answer would depend on the results from the investigation but learners should be able to say that the balloons filled up and became bigger (some more than others).</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Were the changes the same in each balloon? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The answer would depend on the results from the investigation but they should be able to observe that the balloons with the small amount of sugar only increased a little bit but the ones with more sugar in increased more in size.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Explain why you think these changes occurred differently in the contents of each of your balloons. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The answer would depend on the results from the investigation but learners should be able to say that the balloons with a greater concentration sugar were able to ferment more quickly or for a longer time than the ones with a smaller concentration of sugar.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">How did you expect the balloons to react after 3 days? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. Learners might indicate that they thought the balloons would just continue blowing up / increasing in size, or they may have hypothesised that once the sugar was used up the balloons would stay the same size (or even decrease).</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Describe how each of the balloons actually looked after the 3 days. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The answer would depend on the results from the investigation but in most cases the balloons should have decreased in size.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Provide a possible explanation for your observations. Think for instance of what could possibly have been lost from the balloons. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The answer would depend on the results from the investigation but learners should be able to conclude that the sugar in the solution has all been used, so no new carbon dioxide was being made, and the carbon dioxide in the balloons slowly began to escape through the walls of the balloon.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">At the start you added yeast, sugar granules and water. Describe how the contents of each of the balloons looked at the end of the investigation. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The answer would depend on the results from the investigation but learners should be able to describe the light brown fizzy contents that has a distinct sour smell and flavour.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What did you learn from doing this investigation? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learners may conclude that the more sugar was added the more gas was produced.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p><strong> A simplified version</strong> of this investigation can also be done:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Provide learners with 4 bottles.</li>
<li>Dissolve half a packet of instant yeast into each of the 4 bottles.</li>
<li>Mark the bottles A - D.</li>
<li>Bottle A should have normal tap water with only the yeast dissolved in it. Stretch a balloon over the top of the bottle.</li>
<li>Bottle B should have the yeast dissolved in lukewarm water (not too hot). Stretch a balloon over the top.</li>
<li>Bottle C should have normal tap water with 10 ml of sugar dissolved with the 7 g (half a packet) of yeast. Stretch a balloon over the top.</li>
<li>Bottle D should have 40 degree C water with 10 ml of sugar dissolved with the 7 g (half a packet) of yeast. Stretch a balloon over the top.</li>
<li>The balloons will of course fill with carbon dioxide - with Bottle D filling the fastest as the conditions are most perfect for this in that bottle. </li>
</ul><p/>
</div>
<p><strong>Part 2: Yeast growth at different temperatures</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>Conduct this investigation again, but this time you need to find out the best temperature for yeast growth. A suggestion is to use 10 ml of sugar for each of the balloons and 7 g of instant yeast (or 2 teaspoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of yeast). Why do you need to add the same amount of yeast and sugar to all containers? You will need to change the temperature of the water however to measure the optimum temperature for yeast to ferment.</p>

<p/>

<p>Write an experimental report, using the headings of AIM, HYPOTHESIS, MATERIALS, METHOD, RESULTS AND OBSERVATIONS, DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION.</p>

<p/>

<p>Remember to evaluate your results and discuss any difficulties you might have had or ways to improve your experimental design. In your discussion, you will also need to do some extra research about the applications of this process and include this information. Do not forget to reference your sources in a bibliography at the end.</p>

<p>Besides the use of microorganisms in food and food-making processes, there are also other processes for which we use microorganisms. Specific microorganisms are used in water treatment, like when treating sewage on a large scale.</p>

<p/>

<p>In biotechnology research, microorganisms are being used to produce alternative, renewable energy, for example, biogas and biofuels.</p>

<p/>

<p>Microorganisms are used in the development of various medicines, for example, <strong>antibiotics</strong>. Penicillin is a group of antibiotics which come from <em>Penicillium</em> fungi. The discovery of penicillin and its uses to treat certain bacterial infections happened by chance. This was due to the curiosity of a scientist, Alexander Fleming, and this led to the discovery of many more antibiotics.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8ll03-gd-0037.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1928.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Microorganisms are also used in many fields of science and medical research. Scientists use yeast to learn more about many other types of organisms. The use of viruses is also currently being explored in many universities around the world to actually help with cures for various conditions, even cancer! The possibilities for discovery are endless!</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Careers as a natural scientist</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is a suggested CAPS activity, but it is not for assessment purposes. Learners should start to learn about and explore various careers within the Natural Sciences. A variety of career options are suggested by this activity. Ideally all of the careers in the list should be represented by at least one student. This is a good chance for learners to explore their interests, so those who already have well-developed passions and interests should be encouraged to explore them further with this activity. If a learner has a career not on this list that is related to Natural Sciences they may talk about their choice instead.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Learners should be able to show that the person might breathe in the virus/bacteria after someone has coughed without a hand or tissue in front of their mouths; touch another or touch an object where the bacteria is on; drink water that has not been sterilised; eat food that contains the virus / bacteria or have a mosquito or other insect bite the person.</p>

<p/><p>People are indoors with windows and doors closed, and are more likely to huddle together, thus if someone sneezes it travels within the small confines of the room and fresh breezes do not come in from the windows and doors and blow the tiny droplets containing viruses away.</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Either they would drink the water from a contaminated source without sterilising the water first, or they would eat fruit or vegetables that has been sprayed with this water and they might not wash it first before eating it and thus they get contaminated.</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>People in poverty cannot often get the medical help because they cannot afford to visit the doctor, live far away from clinics, have no transport or cannot travel fast enough to the hospitals to get their children treated in developing countries. The malaria in developing countries might be worsened by malnutrition and poor hygiene which might make the child too weak to survive. People living in developing countries might not be able to afford the preventative sprays that prevent the mosquitoes from biting them, and the soaps to wash away or kill bacteria .In poor communities, there is a huge lack in proper sanitation and sewage systems. This makes it much easier for disease-causing pathogens to travel in contaminated water and cause diarrhoea. Stagnant water areas are more common in third world countries which are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.</p>
