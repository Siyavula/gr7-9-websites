<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>This chapter builds on the brief introduction to chemical reactions that was covered in Chapter 1 (Atoms) of Gr. 8 Matter and Materials, specifically the paragraph Pure Substances. The important message of this chapter is that atoms are rearranged during a chemical reaction. The atoms do not change, but how they are arranged in relation to each other does change. That means that the molecules change, even though the number of each kind of atom present at the start of the reaction, stays the same throughout. To help learners make this important conceptual connection, particle diagrams are used to represent some of the reactions in this chapter. Learners will also be given an opportunity to draw such diagrams themselves in the activities and review questions of this chapter.</p>

<p/>

<p>The activity 'Can we use a chemical reaction to see inside an egg?'takes a few days. It is suggested that you start with it during the first lesson of this chapter. It will help to show learners that chemical change is usually observable on the macroscopic scale and that macroscopic observations provide evidence of activity on the level of particles.</p>

<p/>

<p>It is also a good idea to make the limewater needed for the investigation 'Can clear limewater be used to detect carbon dioxide?'before you start this chapter. To make clear limewater follow the instructions below:</p>

<p/>

<p><u>Instructions for making clear limewater</u></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>Place a few tablespoons of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, in a clear 500 ml reagent bottle and fill with water. Shake or stir to make a cloudy suspension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave the suspension to settle for a few days. The clear liquid above the solid Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> is a saturated solution of Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, also known as clear limewater.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carefully decant as much of this as you need, without stirring up the solid Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> sludge at the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make more, simply add more water, shake it up and let it settle again. When the sludge dissolves completely, simply add more solid Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p/>

<p/>

<p>In the last chapter we looked at the particle model of matter and specifically at changes of state. Do you remember heating and cooling candle wax to observe it melt and then solidify. The wax first changed from a solid into a liquid and then back to a solid again. These are <strong>physical</strong> changes. The chemical properties of the substance does not change.</p>

<p/>

<p>We are now going to look at what happens when we get <strong>chemical</strong> changes in substances. These take place during <strong>chemical reactions.</strong></p>

<p/>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-1">How do we know a chemical reaction has taken place?</h2>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>chemical reaction</li>
<li>reaction flask or <br/>reaction vessel</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>During a chemical reaction, one or more substances are changed into new substances. Do you know of any chemical reactions? Can you mention one or two examples? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners may remember that the rusting of iron is a chemical reaction, or they may cite some of the reactions from Chapter 1 as examples. Learners may also cite 'change of state' as a reaction. However, this is NOT a chemical reaction or change. Explain to your learners that it is only a physical change taking place not a chemical change.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>How will we know when a chemical reaction is taking place? What are the signs? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Get learners to discuss this in small groups for a few minutes. Make a list on the board of all their suggestions which may include:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The mixture may change and appear different. (In what way? There may be a colour change and bubbles or 'crystals' may form.)</li>
<li>There may be an explosion.</li>
<li>The mixture may change temperature, heating up or cooling down. This is NOT to be confused with physical changes during heating and cooling when a substance melts or solidifies for example.</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>We can tell if a chemical reaction has taken place when one or more of the following things happen:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>There has been a colour change inside the <strong>reaction flask</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>A gas has formed. Usually we know a gas has formed when we can see bubbles. This should not be confused with boiling, which only happens when a liquid is heated to its boiling point.</li>
<li>A solid has formed. Usually we know that some solid material has formed when we can see a sludgy or cloudy deposit, or crystals forming.</li>
</ul><p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Most practical manuals for introductory chemistry list only the three visual cues above as signs that a reaction has taken place. However, the non-visual signs below are also worth including here.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>All the signs listed above are visual, or recorded by sight. That means we can see them. Our other senses can also help us to say whether or not there was a chemical reaction:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Sometimes chemical changes can be smelled, for instance when a new material, that has a strong smell, is formed.</li>
<li>Other chemical changes can be felt, e.g when the reaction produces heat.</li>
<li>Some chemical changes can be heard, e.g. when an explosion takes place.</li>

<p>We will now put our checklist into practice by looking at a reaction safe enough to try at home. Have you ever wondered what a raw egg would look like without its shell? We are going to use a chemical reaction to strip away the shell of an egg, without breaking the egg!</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Can we use a chemical reaction to see inside an egg?</h1><figure><img src="images/gr8mm03-gd-0001.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gemsling/2687069763/"/><figcaption class="caption">How can we make an egg look like this?<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gemsling/2687069763/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/gemsling/2687069763/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Start with this activity as soon as possible, because it takes a few days for the eggshell to dissolve completely. It is probably worthwhile to do the reaction in duplicate in case something goes wrong with the experiment. The egg is very delicate without its shell and may break and then it would be good to have a 'backup' egg.</p>

<p>In order to change a compound into a different compound, we need to change the way in which the atoms in the compound are arranged. This is exactly what a chemical reaction is: a rearrangement of atoms to turn one or more compounds into new compounds.</p>

<p/>

<p>Any time atoms separate from each other and recombine into different combinations of atoms, we say a chemical reaction has occurred.</p>

<p/>

<p>We are going to use coloured circles to represent the atoms in the compounds which take place in chemical reactions. If you still have your beads or playdough from previously, you can also make these reactions yourself on your desk. Look at the following diagram.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp1561120"><img src="images/gr8mm03-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>We have carbon and oxygen on the left of the arrow reacting to make carbon dioxide on the right of the arrow.</p>

<p/>

<p>To the left of the arrow, we have the 'before' situation. This side represents the substances we have before the reaction takes place. They are called the <strong>reactants</strong>.</p>

<p/>

<p>To the right of the arrow we have the 'after' situation. This side represents the substances that we have after the reaction has taken place. They are called the <strong>products.</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>REACTANTS (before the reaction) &#8594; PRODUCTS (after the reaction)</p>

<p/>

<p>Do you see how the atoms have rearranged? This means a chemical reaction has taken place. Label the diagram with 'reactants' and 'product'.</p>

<p/>

<p>The reaction between carbon and oxygen takes place when we burn coal. Coal is carbon and when it burns in oxygen gas, carbon dioxide is formed.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr8mm03-gd-0003.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cote/66570391/"/><figcaption class="caption">Burning coal. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cote/66570391/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/cote/66570391/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>The diagram below represents another chemical reaction. We have oxygen (red molecules) reacting with hydrogen (white molecule) to produce water.</p>

<p/>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp3244144"><img src="images/gr8mm03-gd-0004.png" width="300"/></figure><p>What are the reactants in this reaction? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Oxygen and hydrogen.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>What is the product in this reaction? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Water.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Why do you think hydrogen and oxygen are represented as two atoms joined together? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This links back to what learners covered in Chapter 1 about diatomic molecules. These elements exist as diatomic molecules so they have two atoms joined together.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Do you remember when we spoke about <strong>chemical bonds</strong> between atoms in a molecule in Chapter 1? A chemical bond is a force which holds the atoms together. Therefore, during a chemical reaction, the bonds between atoms have to break so that the atoms can rearrange to form the products. New bonds form between the atoms in the product.</p>

<p/>

<p>Next we will look at a chemical reaction that has been used by humankind for centuries.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-4">Fermentation is a chemical reaction</h3>
<p/>

<p>Have you ever forgotten some milk or juice in a bottle, to find that it has 'gone off' a few days later? If you accidentally tasted it, it may have tasted sour and, in the case of the juice, a bit fizzy as well. Your senses may have warned you not to drink any more of it. Do you remember learning in Gr. 7 that our sense of taste protects us from food that has spoiled?</p>

<p/>

<p>The sour taste of the milk or juice is caused by the products of <strong>fermentation</strong>. Which compounds have a sour taste? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Acids taste sour.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Fermentation does not only produce unwanted products. Yoghurt, buttermilk and cheese are all fermented milk products. In these examples, the fermentation process creates acids that give these foods a sour taste.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr8mm03-gd-0005.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Different dairy products which are made using fermentation.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Fermentation is also the process by which a variety of fruits, vegetables and grains can be used to make alcohol. In many cultures the brewing of alcoholic drinks is part of their indigenous knowledge.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Studying the fermentation reaction</h1>
<p/>

<p>The basic reaction in the fermentation process can be summarised as follows:</p>

<p/>

<p>glucose &#8594; alcohol + carbon dioxide</p>

<p/>

<p>What are the reactants and products in this reaction? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Glucose is the reactant and alcohol and carbon dioxide are the products.</p>

<figure id="gd-idp7860080"><img src="images/gr8mm03-gd-0007.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>In the diagram above, the grey atoms are carbon (C), the red atoms are oxygen (O) and the small, white ones are hydrogen (H). Write in the names of the compounds in this reaction.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners must write glucose on the left and alcohol and then carbon dioxide on the right.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Glucose does not change into alcohol and carbon dioxide by itself! Microorganisms like yeast and bacteria actively ferment glucose.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Yeast produce special chemicals called enzymes that can break down the bonds in sugars such as glucose to form smaller molecules like alcohol and carbon dioxide.</p>

<p/>

<p>In South Africa, a popular drink is ginger or pineapple beer! The fizzy bubbles in the ginger beer or pineapple beer are bubbles of carbon dioxide produced by the yeast during fermentation. Let's make some ginger beer!</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This is an extension activity and can be performed if you have time in class. It may also be done as a <strong>project.</strong> We will also look at fermentation again in Matter and Materials next term. In fermentation, the glucose is incompletely broken down, so it yields less energy (in the form of ATP) than respiration. Fermentation is also anaerobic meaning it does not require oxygen, whereas respiration requires oxygen. Alcohol is produced during fermentation. However, <strong>ginger beer is non-alcoholic</strong>. Although it is called 'beer', it is not alcoholic because it is not fermented for long enough.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Many learners might wonder, what is the difference between a chemist and a chemical engineer?</p>

<p/>

<p>A <strong>chemist</strong> studies the composition and properties of matter. They use the knowledge they gain to develop new compounds, products and processes to improve our daily lives. A chemist requires an extensive knowledge of chemistry and must be competent in a laboratory. Chemists often research chemical reactions to be able to produce new materials and compounds. These could be new medicines, innovative building materials, new fuels that do not harm the environment, and many others. Researching new chemical reactions is complicated. The work is often researched in teams with other scientists and engineers.</p>

<p/>

<p>A <strong>chemical engineer</strong> is usually involved in developing ways to produce the new compounds developed by the chemist on a large scale or to find ways of lowering the cost of producing those compounds. A chemical engineer needs a general knowledge of chemistry but also needs to know a lot about processes and what drives them.</p>

<p/>

<p>A researcher works to discover something new, or a new way of doing things, while an engineer optimises a known process or figures out the best way to make a known compound.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>Invite a chemist/engineer:</strong> Do you know someone who is a chemist or a chemical engineer? Perhaps you live near a university? If you do, you could invite a chemist or engineer to come to your school and talk to your class about the work that chemists do. Alternatively, you could visit the chemist or engineer at their workplace and ask them to show you around. You could get your learners to prepare a few questions beforehand: you could ask them about their work, their training and what they think are the qualities needed if one wanted to become a chemist. Just remember to make an appointment first! This activity could be turned into a small group project. Learners could be required to write a short report on the information they have gathered. It is not for assessment purposes.</p>
