<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>The first chapter in the Planet Earth and Beyond strand looked at the spheres of the Earth. The atmosphere was briefly introduced in this chapter and is now covered in more detail.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is the layer of gases around the Earth. The important concepts that need to be understood in this chapter are:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the air we breathe does not contain 'nothing', but rather an important mix of gases which support and sustain life on Earth</li>
<li>gravity causes the density gradient in the atmosphere, and makes the atmosphere 'stick' to Earth</li>
<li>the temperature in the atmosphere varies with altitude as a result of radiation from the Earth, the specific gases present at different altitudes, chemical reactions taking place in the atmosphere, and the energy from the Sun.</li>
</ul><p>The concept of space and the 'nothingness' that we breathe might be difficult for learners to comprehend. We have included a number of models and pictures to help them visualise the vastness of space, and understand that the atmosphere, which surrounds us, is required for life on this planet.</p>

<p>A common misconception is that land plants generate most of the oxygen in the atmosphere, whereas this actually occurs in the oceans where \(\text{70}\)% of the planet's oxygen supply is produced.</p>

<p>Direct sunlight does not heat the atmosphere. Only a small portion of the heating can be accounted for by direct sunlight, most of the heating is through conduction, convection and re-radiation of the Sun's energy.</p>

<p>Another misconception is that greenhouse gases make up a major part of the atmosphere. Nitrogen and oxygen make up \(\text{99}\)% of the atmosphere while other gases, including greenhouse gases, make up only about \(\text{1}\)%.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of Planet Earth and Beyond, you learnt about the different spheres of the Earth. The atmosphere was mentioned briefly in Chapter 1. In this chapter we will look at the atmosphere in more detail.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is the layer of gases which surrounds the Earth. It contains the following mixture:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>nitrogen (78,08%)</li>
<li>oxygen (20,95%)</li>
<li>argon (0,93%)</li>
<li>carbon dioxide and other trace gases (0,04%)</li>
</ul><figure><img src="images/gr9eb04-gd-0002.png" width="200"/><figcaption class="caption">The composition of the atmosphere by volume.</figcaption></figure><p>The gas molecules in the atmosphere are kept close to the Earth by gravity. The effect of gravity means that there will be more gas molecules closer to the Earth's surface than further away. As you move further and further away from the surface of the Earth, the gas molecules become fewer and the spaces between the molecules become larger, until there are no more gas molecules and only spaces left. The atmosphere therefore does not have a set boundary, but rather fades away into space.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Sports teams and athletes need to acclimatize when they get to a new location at altitude, before performing, so that their bodies can get used to the lower level of oxygen.</p>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Some endurance athletes spend several weeks training at high altitudes, preferably 2400 m above sea level, so that their bodies adapt by producing more red blood cells. This gives them a competitive advantage when returning to a lower altitude to compete.</p>
</div>
<p>When we walk up a very high mountain, there is less oxygen present. We may feel out of breath. People sometimes say that the air is thinner higher up. When they say this they mean that there is a lower concentration of oxygen molecules.</p>

<p>The <strong>density</strong> of the atmosphere decreases with an increase in the height above sea level (altitude). Density is an indication of how many particles are present in a specific volume of gas. When the density is high, there are lots of gas molecules present. If the density is low, there are fewer gas molecules present.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is a very important part of the Earth. It keeps the planet warm and protects us from the harmful radiation of the Sun. It also ensures a healthy balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide so that life can be sustained on the planet.</p>

<p>The atmosphere has four main layers. We start measuring these from sea level and move towards space. The diagram alongside illustrates this. The surface of the Earth is at the bottom of the diagram, with Mount Everest drawn in. The first layer is the <strong>troposphere</strong>, then the <strong>stratosphere</strong>, the <strong>mesosphere</strong> and the <strong>thermosphere</strong>. Above the thermosphere, the atmosphere merges with outer space in the layer known as the <strong>exosphere</strong>.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The exosphere is not considered part of the atmosphere due to the very low density of gases, but it is still briefly discussed in this chapter. In some other resources which you may look at, the exosphere is sometimes discussed as a layer or upper limit of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is denser closer to the surface than further away. This can be indicated by using darker going to lighter colours, or using more dots and fewer dots, or any other way of indicating that the atmosphere is denser at the bottom. A scale needs to be included. A possible diagram could look like this:</p>

</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Each layer of the atmosphere has a different <strong>temperature gradient</strong>, in other words, the temperature changes gradually as you move through each layer. The following graph shows how the temperature changes as you move through the atmosphere. The layers of the atmosphere are also indicated on the graph. Temperature is on the x-axis and altitude is on the y-axis. The red line shows the change in temperature. Note that as you move further to the left on the graph it is colder, dropping far below 0 &#176;C, and further to the right is hotter, reaching over 1000 &#176;C.</p>

</div>
<p>Now let's look at each of the layers of the atmosphere.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-2">The troposphere</h2><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The boundaries between the layers in the atmosphere are not as clear as the boundaries between liquids. The values are often given as a range and the transitions take place in zones called pauses, for example the tropopause is the zone in-between the troposphere and the stratosphere.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The troposphere is the lowest layer in the atmosphere. It stretches from sea level up to about 9 km at the poles and 17 km at the equator. Due to the Earth's rotation, the atmosphere is thicker at the equator than at the poles. On average it is about 12 km thick.</p>

<p>The density of air decreases as you move further away from the surface of the Earth. The first two layers of the atmosphere contain most of the mass of the atmosphere. The bottom part of the troposphere has a high enough density for us to breathe and is the layer of the atmosphere in which we live.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9eb04-gd-0008.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Shown here is the orange-coloured troposphere, the lowest and most dense portion of the Earth's atmosphere above the Earth's surface, with the Moon above.</figcaption></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Troposphere comes from the Greek word <em>tropein,</em> meaning to change, circulate or mix.</p>
</div>
<p>The air in the troposphere is in constant motion. As it is warmed by the Earth, the warm air moves away and gets replaced by cooler air which travels in convection currents. This is the basis for cloud formation and weather patterns. All the Earth's weather systems take place close to the Earth in the troposphere.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9eb04-gd-0009.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Cloud formations typical of a tropical cyclone. This one was photographed approaching the southeastern coast of Brazil.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9eb04-gd-0010.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Clouds forming in the troposphere.</figcaption></figure><p>The temperature in the troposphere decreases with altitude - the further you move away from the surface, the colder it becomes. The temperature decreases about 6,4&#176;C for every kilometre increase in altitude. In the following activity you will investigate the change in temperature as height above sea level increases.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Drawing a graph of the temperature gradient in the troposphere</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If you would like to assess learners' tables and graphs you can use Assessment Rubric 3 and 4 to do so. As an extension you could get the learners to draw a similar graph for the change in pressure as you move through the troposphere. They will have to first find out what the pressure gradient is in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The temperature in the troposphere decreases steadily until it reaches about -60&#176;C at about 10-12 km above sea level. The temperature here stabilises before it increases again. This is the transition zone between the troposphere and the stratosphere. This layer forms an invisible barrier which prevents the warmer moist air from escaping from the troposphere. Beyond this region air does not circulate much and weather patterns are not found any more.</p>

<li>CFCs</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The stratosphere is the layer above the troposphere. It stretches from 12 km to 50 km above the surface of the Earth. 90% of the mass of the atmosphere is found in the troposphere and the stratosphere.</p>

<p>Aeroplanes fly in the lower stratosphere because the air is much more stable than in the troposphere. The density of the air in the stratosphere is very low and decreases with altitude.</p>

<p>Scientists use <strong>weather balloons</strong> to gather information on the temperature and pressure as they move up from the Earth's surface to the stratosphere. A weather balloons carries a small device, called a radiosonde, which sends back information on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Weather balloons were first used 70 years ago, and are still the key instrument for meteorologists to assess and predict the weather. This information is used in many ways, for example, to compile the weather report on TV or to warn of flooding or issue a hurricane warning.</p>

</div>
<p>Weather balloons are filled with helium or hydrogen and rise higher and higher into the atmosphere. Do you think they continue rising up for ever? What do you think happens to the balloon as it increases in altitude? Hint: Think of what happens to the gas inside the balloon as the altitude increases. Discuss this with your class and take some notes below.</p>

<p>Discuss this with your class as it provides a good opportunity to revise some of the concepts learned in Gr 8 on the particle model of matter, as well as extend this knowledge. As the weather balloon rises higher and higher in the atmosphere, the pressure decreases. The volume of gas inside the balloon therefore increases and the balloon expands. Eventually it gets to a point where the balloon material cannot stretch anymore and the balloon bursts. This usually happens between 25 and 30 km above the Earth's surface. You can also explain to learners that the radiosonde has a small parachute attached to it which opens up when it begins to fall back to Earth. This is to slow its fall so that it does not crash down and cause damage to someone or something. Also, these sensors are never retrieved. Scientists don't need to retrieve them to get the information back because data will have been sent by radio signals.</p>

<p>Ozone gas (O<sub>3</sub>) is found in the stratosphere. Ozone gas is made up of ozone molecules. Each molecule consists of three oxygen atoms. Ozone plays an important role in absorbing harmful UV rays from the Sun by forming, breaking down and reforming ozone molecules over and over again. When UV light reaches the Earth, it can cause cancer, affect plant growth, and the life cycles of species.</p>

<p>The formation and destruction of ozone is a natural process that takes place in the stratosphere. Oxygen forms ozone, and ozone breaks apart again to form oxygen. The following diagram shows the reactions that take place.</p>

<p>Although ozone is considered a pollutant in the troposphere, in higher altitudes in the stratosphere, ozone is considered vital as it protects Earth from too much ultraviolet radiation.</p>
</div>
<p>The ozone reactions lead to the heating of the stratosphere, increasing the temperature from -60&#176;C to about 0&#176;C. As a result, the air becomes warmer as you move further away from the Earth in the stratosphere.</p>

<p>The problem comes in when there are molecules present which interfere with these natural processes. Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, are molecules which release chlorine atoms into the stratosphere. Chlorine atoms react with ozone, destroying it before it can absorb harmful UV rays. The following diagram show how CFCs react with ozone.</p>

<p>The mesosphere extends from around 50 km to 80 km above the Earth's surface. The atmosphere reaches its lowest temperature (-90 &#176;C) in the mesosphere. The air density is extremely low, but there is still enough air to burn up rocks and dust entering from space.</p>

<p>A <strong>meteor</strong> is a rock that enters the atmosphere from space. It travels at extremely high speed, up to 30 000 m/s. As a meteor enters the atmosphere, the air in front of it is compressed. The air heats up and the meteor burns up as a result of heat and friction. When we look up at the night sky, we might see a streak of light flashing for a brief moment. This is commonly called a shooting star, but is in fact a meteor burning up in the mesosphere.</p>

Some of the larger, denser meteors can reach the Earth and are then called <strong>meteorites</strong>.

<p>The thermosphere is the layer of the atmosphere from 80 km upwards. The density of the air is extremely low. The further away you move from the Earth, the less dense the concentration of molecules becomes until the atmosphere becomes space.</p>

<p>Most satellites that we depend on every day are in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), orbiting the Earth at an altitude between 160 km and 2,000 km. The International Space Station  (ISS) is situated at 370 km in the thermosphere. This is an international facility in space that is used for research purposes.</p>

<p>The temperature in the thermosphere increases from - 90&#176;C to as high as 1500&#176;C. The thermosphere is very sensitive to an increase in energy and a small change in energy results in a high temperature increase. At times of increased solar activity, the temperature can easily increase up to 1500&#176;C. However, the thermosphere will feel cold as there are few particles present to collide with our skin and transfer enough energy for us to feel the heat.</p>

<p>High energy light (for example, UV light) can cause atoms or molecules to lose electrons, forming ions. The region where this takes place is called the <strong>ionosphere</strong>. The ionosphere is found mainly in the thermosphere. The Sun also gives off charged particles (the solar wind), which can enter the Earth's atmosphere (mostly near the poles) and react with the ions and electrons in the ionosphere, causing a phenomenon called the <strong>aurora</strong>. It is a colourful display of light in the sky at the poles. In the northern hemisphere, it is called the <strong>northern lights</strong> or <strong>aurora borealis</strong>, and the <strong>southern lights</strong> or <strong>aurora australis</strong> in the southern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The ionosphere reflects longer wavelength radio waves, for example the radio waves we use for radio and surface-broadcast television (not satellite television), allowing the signal to be broadcast over a larger distance. The ions in the ionosphere also absorb ultraviolet radiation and X-rays.</p>

<p>The region beyond the thermosphere is called the <strong>exosphere</strong>. This layer has very few molecules and extends into space.</p>

<p>You have learned a lot about greenhouse gases in Natural Sciences. In this section we will be looking at how important greenhouse gases are to sustain life on Earth.</p>

<p>Earth's atmosphere contains mostly (99%) nitrogen and oxygen, but a small percentage (1%) of the atmosphere contains gases like <strong>water vapour</strong> (H<sub>2</sub>O), <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> (CO<sub>2</sub>) and <strong>methane</strong> (CH<sub>4</sub>). Carbon dioxide is a product of respiration in all organisms and also a gas given off by industrial processes and the burning of fossil fuels and vegetation. Methane is a gas, also called natural gas, which occurs in reservoirs beneath the surface of the Earth. It is also given off by decomposing plant and animal material and animals give off methane as part of their digestion. Water vapour is formed when water evaporates on Earth.</p>

<p>Water vapour, methane and carbon dioxide are gases which let through incoming visible light from the Sun. The incoming radiation from the Sun is absorbed by the Earth's surface and warms it. The Earth's surface emits <strong>infrared radiation</strong>. Infrared radiation is absorbed by the greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. This increases the temperature of the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere, above what it would be without the gases, called the <strong>greenhouse effect</strong>. These gases are very important to regulate the Earth's temperature.</p>

</div>
<p>As you can see in the diagram, the radiation from the Sun is able to reach the Earth and warm it up. The energy that is given off by the Earth is trapped by the water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane. This ensures that the Earth stays warm. It is almost as if the gases form a blanket around the Earth keeping some of the heat inside. The gases are referred to as <strong>greenhouse gases</strong>. A greenhouse is a glass structure that is used to grow plants. The glass lets the heat of the Sun through, but then keeps the heat inside the structure so that the plants have a moderate climate in which to grow. Water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane act in the same way.</p>

<p>Another analogy of the greenhouse effect is to think about a car parked in the Sun with the windows shut. After awhile it will heat up inside the car.</p>

<p>The atmospheres of Venus and Mars are very similar. Both planets have mainly carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and very little other gases. However, the two planets are quite different.</p>

<p>Venus has a very dense atmosphere which results in a high concentration of carbon dioxide on its surface. This causes an extreme greenhouse effect and very high temperatures on the surface of Venus. Venus has an average surface temperature of 462 &#176;C. This is too high to sustain life as we know it.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system; the temperature is hot enough to melt lead.</p>
</div>
<p>Mars, on the other hand, has almost no atmosphere, so, although there is carbon dioxide present, the density is very low and almost no greenhouse effect takes place. Mars is also much further away from the Sun. It is a very cold planet, with an average temperature of -55&#176;C. This is too low to sustain life as we know it.</p>

<p>Earth has the right composition of atmospheric gases to sustain life. It has the right balance between oxygen and nitrogen so that plants and animals can breathe, and just enough carbon dioxide and methane to keep the planet warm enough so that life can be sustained. Many scientists think that it is the life on Earth that keeps the atmosphere in this perfect balance. Plants produce oxygen and re-circulate carbon dioxide on Earth. They believe that if life were to disappear from Earth, the atmosphere would become like Mars or Venus.</p>

<p>In the greenhouse effect, carbon dioxide traps the heat of the Sun. In this investigation, you will use bottles with air and carbon dioxide, respectively, to model the greenhouse effect. You are going to investigate the following question: Does air or carbon dioxide absorb more heat?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>CAPS prescribes plastic bags, we have used plastic cold drink bottles as it makes data collection easier.</p>

<p>You can make the holes in the lids of the bottles beforehand using a knife or by hammering a nail in through the lid. Otherwise learners will need to do this and you will need a hammer, a nail about the width of the thermometer and a wooden block to hammer into.</p>

<p>You can prepare and collect small bottles of carbon dioxide beforehand, otherwise learners will need to do this. To collect a bottle of carbon dioxide, add one tablespoon of bicarbonate of soda to the small bottle. Add 10-20 ml of vinegar and place the lid back on. Hold the mouth of the small bottle over the CO<sub>2</sub> container and pour the carbon dioxide into the large bottle. Carbon dioxide is denser than air and can therefore be poured into the large bottle. Add more vinegar when the effervescence stops. Repeat 2-3 times until the large bottle is full. If a burning match at the mouth of the bottle goes out immediately, the bottle is full.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners should have seen from the last investigation that if the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases increase in the atmosphere, then the temperature will increase as greenhouse gases trap more heat.</p>

<p>If there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, more ultraviolet radiation will be trapped and the Earth will heat up. This will result in more of the polar ice melting than usual. Even a one degree difference in the average temperature has an effect on the melting of polar ice. If more ice than usual melts, the water levels in the oceans will rise and low-lying areas could flood.</p>

<p>A change in the temperature will also result in a change in weather patterns. More rain will fall in some areas, and less in others. If this change is permanent, it is called <strong>climate change</strong>, and if it occurs on a worldwide scale it is called global climate change, which is what is being discussed here.</p>

<p>Global warming affects weather patterns which in turn has a knock-on effect on agriculture and food production. This has an impact on food production and can lead to food shortage for humans and animals. Long term climate change can lead to the extinction of plants and animals, which are unable to adapt to changed conditions.</p>

<p>The levels of greenhouse gases vary naturally over time. A question that scientists often ask is whether the concentration of greenhouse gases is rising more than it would naturally as a result of human activities? How do you think this can be investigated?</p>

<p>Since the industrial revolution humans have burned more fossil fuels than ever before. Human activities have resulted in the increase of carbon dioxide emissions over time. Carbon dioxide is therefore the main greenhouse gas under discussion amongst scientists and environmentalist. The following investigation will look at the levels of carbon dioxide over thousands of years.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide is trapped in the ice which forms at the poles. As the ice is compacted and becomes thicker over thousands of years, the carbon dioxide remains trapped. The levels of carbon dioxide in ice can be determined by analysing the ice cores. A research team in Antarctica drilled an ice core containing ice from 160 000 years ago. They analysed the ice for carbon dioxide and presented their data in the following table.</p>

<p>It is important that learners complete this concept map to consolidate what they have learned. They can either do it as a homework exercise or if enough time is available, a whole period can be dedicated to this activity. Learners have been exposed to many concept maps up until now and have had to make their own from scratch for some of the smaller chapters. Learners now have to put these skills into practice for a more complex concept map. This will be good preparation for learners' examinations. There are no right and wrong answers for the concept map. An example concept map is provided here. If learners are battling, you could use this following map as a guide and with the class, draw a concept map on the board. However, do not just draw it up for learners to copy down. Learners must be actively involved in the construction. You may also come up with alternative ways of presenting the concepts.</p>

<p>Venus and Mars contains equal amounts of carbon dioxide, yet the temperature on the surfaces of these two planets are very different. Explain why. [4 marks]</p>

<p>Venus is closer to the Sun. Both have CO<sub>2</sub>, but Venus' atmosphere is much denser. The greenhouse effect is much more dominant, resulting in a much hotter surface temperature. Mars has lots of CO<sub>2</sub>, but it is not very dense and therefore the greenhouse effect is not observed.</p>

<p>Earth is the only planet that we know of that sustains life. What makes Earth's atmosphere suitable to sustain life? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Earth has enough oxygen and not a lot of CO<sub>2</sub>. There are just enough greenhouse gases to ensure that the Earth is kept warm enough. It has just the right balance between CO<sub>2</sub> and oxygen/other gases.</p>

<p>It is the gradual increase in the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub> means that the greenhouse effect will increase and temperatures on Earth will rise. If this continues over a long time, ice will melt, water levels will rise, coastlines will change, weather patterns will be influenced, crop production will be affected, and it could lead to the extinction of animal and plant species that are unable to adapt.</p>
