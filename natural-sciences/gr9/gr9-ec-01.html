<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>This chapter introduces learners to the concept of a force. Learners would have been exposed to some of the concepts around forces in previous grades, for example:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>Gr. 8 <strong>Static electricity</strong> introduced learners to friction and electrostatic force; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gr. 8 <strong>Energy transfer in electrical systems</strong> introduced learners to the attraction and repulsion forces between magnets when looking at the magnetic effect of an electric current.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Learners will discover that there are two main categories of forces, namely contact and non-contact forces. They will be introduced to the concept of force fields. This chapter has many opportunities for getting the learners to engage physically with the concepts. Have learners pull and push objects and move each other around the classroom or outside in the school grounds. Have them push against buildings to experience the resistance offered by surfaces. Allow them to walk on different surfaces and feel the effects of friction.</p>

<p>There are many tasks included in this chapter. You might not have time to cover all of them. Some are extension tasks and some tasks are revision from Gr. 7 and 8. You will need to assess the requirements and capabilities of your class in order to decide which tasks to perform. There is a lot of content to cover in this chapter and many concepts form the foundation for what learners will cover in Physical Sciences in Gr. 10-12. You might need to spend more than the allocated 2 weeks of time that is specified in CAPS. Some of the other chapters in this term might not require as much time.</p>

<p>Think of the following situation: You are all helping your teacher to rearrange the classroom and she asks you to move her desk from one side of the classroom to the other. How would you do that? The desk is too heavy for you to lift, so how do you get it across the classroom?</p>

<p>That is right, you are going to either push it or pull it across the room. In doing so, you have exerted a force on the desk to get it to move.</p>

<p>A force is a push or a pull on an object. The unit in which we measure force is a <strong>newton (N)</strong>. It is named after Sir Isaac Newton, an English physicist and mathematician. Sir Isaac Newton is recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all times. The unit of force is named after him in recognition of his work in mechanics and his three laws of motion.</p>

<p>We use forces every day of our lives. Our own bodies rely on forces. Our muscles pull on our bones to allow us to move. Our feet push on the ground when we walk. To open doors, to pick up our food - everything we do involves some kind of force.</p>

<p>What can forces do? Let's experiment with forces and see what we can do.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">What can forces do?</h1>
<p>This activity is all about experimenting with different objects and seeing what happens to them when we push and pull them. Learners should see that pushing on solid objects accelerates them. Pushing or pulling on sponges, balloons and play dough distorts their shape and the ball can be made to move. Each group will need the materials listed below.</p>

</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Effects of forces</h3>
<p>From the last activity, you should have seen that forces can have the following effects:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>Forces can change the <strong>shape</strong> of an object. This is called deformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forces can change the <strong>motion</strong> of an object. If an object is stationary, a force can cause the object to start moving. Or, if an object is already moving, a force can cause an object to speed up or slow down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forces can change the <strong>direction</strong> in which an object is moving.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>How do we describe the motion of an object? When an object is moving, we say it has a <strong>velocity</strong>. Velocity is the rate of change of the position of an object. Velocity is the speed of an object and the direction in which it is moving. Speed describes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity gives both how fast and in what direction the object is moving.</p>

<p>An object can move at constant velocity. This means it travels at the same speed in the same direction. For example a car travelling along the highway at 100 km/h in a straight line has a constant velocity. However, what happens when the car moves faster or slows down?</p>

<p>We saw in the last activity that we could change the motion of an object by applying a force to make it speed up or slow down. The velocity of the object is changing over time due to a force acting on it. This is called <strong>acceleration</strong>. Acceleration is the rate of change of a body's velocity with time. In other words, it is a measure of how an object's speed changes every second.</p>

<p>What we saw in the last activity is that whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force back on the first object. You saw this when you pushed against a wall. We say that forces act in pairs. Newton called the one force the <strong>action</strong>, and the other force the <strong>reaction</strong>, as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp4116224"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0016.png" width="300"/></figure><p>We also saw that when you exerted a force on the wall, you experienced the wall exerting a force back on you. Forces act in pairs on different objects. The force exerted by the second object is <strong>equal in strength</strong> and <strong>opposite in direction</strong> to the first force.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>What we have described here is actually Newton's Third Law of Motion. The law states that when one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in strength and opposite in direction to that of the first body.</p>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>If you take Physical Sciences in Gr. 10-12, you will study Newton's laws in more detail in Gr. 11. You will see how these three laws laid the foundation for classical mechanics, one of the oldest and largest subjects in science, engineering and technology.</p>
</div>
<p>In the last activity, we also saw that more than one force can act on an object at the same time. For example, when two of you were pushing or pulling on your friend in the middle. The effect of the different forces acting together depends on how big each force is and what direction each force is acting in. When two or more forces act on an object, then the forces combine to make a <strong>net</strong> (overall) force.</p>

<p>What happened when both of you pushed or pulled with an equal force? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Nothing happened as the learner remained stationary.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>When the forces are equal to each other and opposite in direction, they balance each other and we say that the net force is 0 N.</p>

<p>What happened when one of you pushed or pulled harder than the other person? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The learner in the middle moved in the direction of the bigger force.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>When the forces are acting in opposite directions, but are not equal, we say that the net force is greater than 0 N. There is a <strong>resultant force</strong>. If the forces are equal and acting in the same direction there will also be a resultant force.</p>

<p>Imagine a tug-of-war. People on either side pull on the rope. If they exert forces of equal size then the rope remains stationary. If one group is able to exert a larger force than the other group, then the rope will move in the direction of the larger force. This is because the forces are unbalanced and there is a <strong>net</strong> (resultant) force acting in the direction of the larger force.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0017.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Playing tug-of-war</figcaption></figure><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If you have a rope you can get the learners to have a tug-of-war outside on the school field. You can have the children on one side pull while the other side remains idle. Then have both sides pull at the same time. This would be a good way to have the learners feel the effects of the forces on their own bodies.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>You also saw that one of you could pull and the other could push in the same direction. In this case, there was a much larger net force as both forces were acting in the same direction and so they add together to produce a bigger overall net force.</p>

<p>We can work out the net forces acting on a body. To do this, we first need to speak about how we represent the forces acting on a body.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Representing forces</h3>
<p>How do we show a force? When we want to draw a diagram to show what forces are acting, we use arrows to represent the forces. We always show forces acting from the centre of the object on which it acts. If we were to draw the force on a ball when it is pushed, it could look like this:</p>
<figure id="gd-idp27869968"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0018.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The direction of the arrow shows the direction in which the force is acting, and the length of the arrow is an indication of the size of the force. A small force would be shown with a short arrow. A large force would be shown with a long arrow.</p>

<p>More than one force can act on an object at the same time. The effect of the different forces acting together depends on how big each force is and what direction each force is acting in.</p>

<p>Let's look at how we can represent the following situation: Jabu pulls Rod's arm with a force of 10 N, while Viantha pulls Rod's other arm with a force of 6 N.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp126752"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0019.png" width="300"/></figure><p>We can represent the forces acting on Rod in the following way: we use a circle to represent Rod and different length arrows to represent the forces acting on him. This is called a free-body diagram.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp2308128"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0020.png" width="300"/></figure><p>What is the net force acting on Rod? We can calculate it as follows:</p>

<p>net force = 10 N + (- 6 N) = 4 N to the left.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The force exerted by Viantha is given a negative value as it is in the opposite direction to the force exerted by Jabu.</p>
</div>
<p>If the forces all act in the same direction then the net force is the sum of the different forces.</p>

<p>Imagine you are pushing someone in a go-cart, and your friend comes to help you push harder. There are now two forces acting on the person in the go-cart. These forces are acting in the same direction so they are added together to produce a net force which is the sum of the two smaller forces.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm3999584"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0021.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>As we will see later on, there are also other forces acting on this system such as friction and weight.</p>

<p>This is an optional activity which you can do with learners if you have internet access to run the PhET simulations.</p>

</li>
</ul><p>It would be a good idea to familiarise yourself with the simulation before allowing the learners to use it. This will ensure that you can help them if they encounter problems with the simulation. When using the programme, it is important that learners stop the simulation each time before adding another force. This link is a pdf download with helpful hints on how to use the simulation: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1cXlC8y">bit.ly/1cXlC8y</a></p>

<li>Tick all the boxes in the top right corner.</li>
<li>Place the blue and red team in such a way that the forces are balanced.</li>
<li>Draw a free body diagram to show the forces acting on the cart. Show the net force (sum of the forces)</li>
</ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> The diagram will be learner dependent. They will have chosen a particular combination of blue and red team members in order to achieve a balanced set of forces. Encourage them to play around with the simulation rather than just choosing the first answer they find. Show them that there are many correct combinations. The diagram they draw should have two arrows of the same length facing in opposite directions and the net force should be equal to zero. Remember never to draw the net force. The simulation will show them the correct answer.</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Reset the simulation.</li>
<li>Place the blue and red team members in such a way as to create an unbalanced force.</li>
<li>Draw a free body diagram to show the forces acting on the cart.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> The vector diagram will be learner dependent. They will have chosen a particular combination of blue and red team members in order to achieve an unbalanced set of forces.

<p>Point out to learners that unbalanced forces result in a change in motion (acceleration) of a body. In the case of the cart, the unbalanced forces are acting in opposite directions and combine by subtraction. But unbalanced forces can also act in the same direction, for example, if two people are pushing the cart with different forces causing it to accelerate forward, the unbalanced forces combine by addition, as opposed to subtraction.</p>

</div>
<p>How do we measure a force? We use an instrument called a spring balance. A spring balance is a simple device consisting of a spring which, when stretched, gives a reading of the force used to stretch the spring.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0022.png" width="100"/><figcaption class="caption">A spring balance.</figcaption></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The functioning of a spring balance is dependent on Hooke's Law which states that when a force stretches or compresses a spring, the distance that the spring moves from its rest position is directly proportional to the size of the force.</p>

<p>There were forces exerted by the magnets but they did not have to touch each other. That means that you do not have to be in contact with something in order to exert a force on it.</p>

<p>There are two types of forces:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><strong>Contact forces</strong>: objects are in contact with each other and exert forces on each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-contact (field) forces</strong>: objects are not in contact with each other and exert forces on each other.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We are now going to look at these two broad groups of forces in more detail.</p></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-7">Contact forces</h2><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>friction</li>
<li>normal force</li>
<li>tension</li>
<li>compression</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Contact forces are forces between objects which are touching each other. Most of the forces that we looked at in the previous section were contact forces, for example, when you push a desk, or pull a go-cart. You are touching the object.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-8">Friction</h3>
<p>What happens when you kick a ball across the grass? The ball moves quickly at first but then slows down again. Something has caused the ball to slow and stop moving. If the motion of the ball has changed then a force must have been exerted on it. The force which opposes motion is called <strong>friction</strong>. Friction forces always act in the opposite direction to the motion of the object. Friction resists movement when the object and surface are in contact. What does that mean? It means that if the ball is moving forward then friction acts backwards on the ball.</p>

<p>The following image shows a ball which has just been kicked. Draw an arrow to show in which direction friction would be acting.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm3216544"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0023.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners must draw the arrow in the opposite direction to the red arrow.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What factors will affect the amount of force required to move objects? We need to look at all the forces acting on an object. Do you remember the following diagram from the beginning of the chapter?</p>
<figure id="gd-idm1533152"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0024.png" width="300"/></figure><p>We only showed the forces of the two learners pushing on the go-cart. What other forces are acting on this go-cart as it moves along?</p>

<p>Friction is acting on the go-cart in the opposite direction to the motion of the go-cart. The go-cart also has a weight. As we learnt in Gr. 8 Planet Earth and Beyond, an object on earth has weight due to the gravitational force of attraction of the Earth on the object. This is a force acting on an object.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We will learn more about weight and the gravitational force in the next section.</p>
</div>
<p>We can now draw the friction and weight in the free-body diagram of the forces acting on the go-cart as follows.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp204496"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0025.png" width="300"/></figure><p>There is another force acting on the go-cart. Think of when you stand on the ground: you feel the ground beneath your feet. This contact force is preventing you from penetrating the ground. This is called the <strong>normal force.</strong> The normal force always acts perpendicularly to the surface that the object is resting on.</p>

<p>In simple situations such as when you are standing on the ground or the go-cart is travelling along a level surface, then the normal force is equal to the weight of the object, but in the opposite direction. Think back to what we learnt about forces acting in pairs. On a flat, level surface, the normal force is the reaction force to the weight of the object. This is shown in the diagram for a box resting on the floor.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm8613024"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0026.png" width="300"/></figure><p>We can now complete the free-body diagram of the forces acting on the go-cart as follows,</p>
<figure id="gd-idp4327264"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0027.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Do you think there is a relationship between the friction that a body experiences and the normal force? Let's investigate.</p>

<p>Explore the forces at work when you try to push a filing cabinet in this simulation.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/19OewvW">bit.ly/19OewvW</a></p>
</div><div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">What is the relationship between the normal force and friction?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This investigation will show the students that the frictional force is related to the <strong>normal force.</strong> The normal force is the reaction of the surface to the weight of an object.</p>

<p>As long as you have a scale you can use any objects as mass pieces. The learners will need to use the spring balances to measure the forces that they exert on the blocks. It is important that they measure the force as the block starts moving, because the reading will drop once the block is moving since kinetic friction is less than static friction.</p>

<p>Learners have already been introduced to weight in previous grades and will cover it in more detail in the next section where they will actually calculate gravitational acceleration for themselves. For now, just use the value of g = 9,8 m/s<sup>2</sup> and then you can refer back to this investigation when learners work out gravitational acceleration for themselves later on.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>INVESTIGATIVE QUESTION:</strong> What is the relationship between the normal force and friction?</p>

<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To determine the relationship between the normal force and the size of the frictional force.</p>

<p>In the situations that we are going to investigate, the object will be pulled along on a flat, level surface. We will increase its mass and measure the resulting frictional force. But how does this relate to the normal force?</p>

<p>Where the object is on a flat level surface, the normal force is equal to the weight. As you learnt in Gr. 8 Planet Earth and Beyond, and will see in the next section, we can calculate the weight of an object. We can therefore calculate the normal force acting on the object.</p>

<p>For this investigation, calculate the weight using the formula W = m &#215; g, where m is the mass of the object in kg and g is 9,8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. We will learn more about this in the next section.</p>

<p>The results obtained will depend on the mass of blocks used and the surface on which the investigation is carried out.

<p>Static friction is the maximum friction reading just as the block starts to move. Then, when the block is moving at a constant speed, the friction decreases and is called moving friction.

<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>What have you learnt about getting an object to move?</li>
</ol><p><em>There needs to be an unbalanced force in order for the object to move. The applied force needs to be greater than the friction force.</em></p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The force of friction depends on the type of surface on which an object is moving and the normal force. In order to get an object to move, a force greater than the frictional force needs to be applied in order to overcome the friction between the object and the surface.</p>

<p>We can now look at the example of pushing a friend in a go-cart again. There is friction between the go-cart and the ground. The friction acts in the opposite direction to the forces pushing the go-cart forward. Therefore, if there are two forces of 7N and 10N pushing the go-cart forward, and the friction is 5 N, we can show only these forces as follows:</p>
<figure id="gd-idm5200064"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0031.png" width="300"/></figure><p>What is the net force acting on the go-cart?</p>

<p>Friction between two surfaces also causes the objects to heat up. Try this out by rubbing your hands vigorously together and then feel your palms afterwards.</p>
</div>
<p>Friction is advantageous for a number of reasons. For example, the friction between our feet and the ground enables us to move forward and prevents us from slipping. Friction is also involved in keeping cars from skidding as the tyres experience friction between the tread and the roadway.</p>

</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-9">Tension and compression</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>In order to introduce these forces, a suggestion is to bring different objects to class to experiment with. An ideal object is a piece of foam as you can then show tension and compression by pulling and pushing it, respectively, and also bending it.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>There are other forces which are contact forces. Look at the following drawing of a boy pulling on a block with a rope.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp245632"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0032.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The person is pulling the rope which is pulling the block. The person is not touching the block directly. The person is pulling the rope and the block is pulling back on the rope in the opposite direction. This causes a <strong>tension</strong> force to exist in the rope. The rope is tight and so there is tension in the rope. Tension is a contact force. The tension in the rope pulls the block across the floor.</p>

<p>Another example of a contact force is <strong>compression</strong>. A compression force is a force which acts to deform or squash an object. Let's think of some examples.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Provide the class with play dough and have them form balls which they can then compress in their hands as in the picture below.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>If you take a ball of dough and crush it with your fingers, you are exerting a compression force on the dough. The dough changes shape. It deforms. Another example is crushing a tennis ball or a cooldrink can between the palms of your hands.</p>

<p>A field is a region in space where an object (with certain properties) will experience a force. Field forces are non-contact forces. Non-contact forces are forces which act over a distance. They do not have to be touching. The most common examples of fields are:</p>

<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-11">Gravitational forces</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered why things fall down and not up?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>You can demonstrate the gravitational effect by dropping objects of different masses from an equal height. Use a tennis ball and a balled-up piece of paper (so that they are approx. the same size and shape). Drop them from the same height and see if the learners can see a difference in the way that they fall. Ask the learners why they think the objects fell. Is something pushing them down? Or pulling them down? Get them to discuss their ideas with each other.</p>

<p>The simulations provided in this chapter are very worthwhile looking at if you have internet access. Otherwise, encourage learners to interact with them in their own time at home or on their mobile phones.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We have already come across gravity in Planet Earth and Beyond in previous grades.</p>
</div>
<p>The force which causes things to fall down towards the Earth and prevents us from falling off the planet is the <strong>gravitational force</strong>. Gravitational forces exist between any two objects with mass and they are forces of attraction (pull).</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Newton developed his Law of Universal Gravitation, describing the force of attraction between bodies with mass in 1687. Newton's work on describing a theory of gravitation may have been inspired by watching an apple fall from a tree.</p>
</div><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Strictly speaking, when talking about "gravity" we are specifically referring to the gravitational force of attraction that occurs between the Earth (or another celestial body like a planet) and other objects, as opposed to the gravitational force in general which acts between any two objects with mass. For example, we would refer to the gravitational force acting to attract objects to the Moon as the gravitational force due to the Moon.</p>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>What is gravity?<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1gN57fo">bit.ly/1gN57fo</a></p>
</div>
<p>The gravitational force is a force that attracts objects with mass towards each other. <em>Any object with mass exerts a gravitational force on any other object with mass</em>. The Earth exerts a gravitational pull on you, the desks in your classroom and the chairs in your classroom, holding you on the surface and stopping you from drifting off into space.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Gravity is a force and is therefore measured in Newtons.</p>
</div>
<p>The Earth's gravitational force pulls everything down towards the centre of the Earth which is why when you drop an object like a book or an apple, it falls to the ground. However, do you know that you, your desk, your chair, and the falling apple and book exert an equal but opposite pull on the Earth? Why do you think these forces on the Earth do not cause the Earth to move noticeably?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The Earth has a much larger mass than a person or a desk and so it is accelerated by a much smaller amount even though the force exerted on the Earth by a desk is the same size as the force exerted on the desk by the Earth (just in opposite directions). This is why the Earth does not move noticeably.</p>

<p>The PhET simulation in the visit box can be used to demonstrate very easily how the gravitational force between two objects increases with mass and decreases as the distance between the objects increases. You can turn off the values, and use the position of the little figures tugging on the ropes to demonstrate the relationships qualitatively.</p>

<p>The Earth attracts us because it has such a large mass and so we are attracted downwards towards the centre of the Earth all the time.</p>

<p><strong>A note on falling objects</strong></p>

<p>A useful way to demonstrate the Earth's gravity is to look at falling objects. An optional extension activity is included below in which learners drop a variety of objects. You can take a vote from the class to see whether learners think that an apple or bag of sugar would hit the ground first. (Answer: they would hit the ground at the same time as long as air resistance is negligible.) It is very likely that learners will have the preconception that heavier items fall faster. It is not important at the moment that the learners' answers are correct and do not try to lead them to the correct answer. They will hopefully discover it for themselves in the following experiment.</p>

<p>In this investigation learners need to work in pairs. They will initially drop a whole apple and half an apple from the same height at the same time. They will then further experiment with balls of different masses (but the same size) and balls of the same mass (but different volumes). It is very hard to drop objects at exactly the same time so that they hit the floor simultaneously so let the learners repeat the experiment several times until they are confident that they are dropping the objects at the same time. If it is hard for them to see which object hits the ground first, suggest to learners that they listen for the number of sounds they hear - one or two - when the objects hit. Learners might need to repeat this investigation many times since it most likely contradicts their preconceptions. Safety tip: It is probably a good idea to have the apples cut in half ahead of time.</p>

<p>Once the learners have finished their experiment you can demonstrate the effects of air resistance by dropping a hammer and a feather. Have the learners take a vote on what will happen when you drop the hammer and feather. Be ready to explain to learners that air resistance slows the fall of the feather and that if there were no air resistance the two would fall at the same rate and hit the floor at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong></p>

<p>Write a conclusion for this investigation.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Learners should have found that the half apple and the whole apple hit the floor at the same time. They should also have found that the balls of the same mass hit the floor at the same time and also the balls of the same volume hit the floor at the same time. From this they should conclude that all objects dropped fall at the same rate no matter what their shape or size if air resistance can be ignored. (Advanced: they <em>accelerate</em> at the same rate). In the case of the hammer and feather drop, learners should have found that the hammer landed first. This is because of the effects of air resistance slowing the feather's fall.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>In an ideal situation, all objects dropped from the same height will land at the same time. This is because the Earth's gravitational force causes each object to get faster by the same amount every second, no matter how heavy it is or what its volume is.</p>

          
<p/>

          
<p><strong>Advanced Teacher Note:</strong></p>

          
<p>According to the Universal Law of Gravitation, the Earth's gravitational force pulls down on an object with a force that is proportional to the mass of the object and the mass of the Earth. In all cases the mass of the Earth is the same and so any differences in the gravitational force on objects on Earth depends only upon the difference in the mass of the objects being dropped.</p>

          
<p>According to Newton's second law, the net force exerted on an object, F, is given by F=ma where m is the mass of the object and a is the acceleration produced by the net force F.</p>

<p>Why do you think the hammer landed before the feather?</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p>In a real situation, the air around us affects how objects fall. As an object moves through the air, and experiences air resistance. The feather is much lighter than the hammer and so the effect of air resistance is much larger on the feather. The net force acting downwards on a falling object is the gravitational force minus force due to air resistance. As the feather is much lighter than the hammer, the net force acting on it will be less and so it will experience a smaller acceleration towards the ground and fall more slowly.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p><strong>Advanced Teacher Note:</strong></p>

<p>Air resistance is a drag force acting to slow the object down. The size of the force depends upon the velocity of the falling object squared, the surface area of the falling object, and the density of the fluid it is falling in (in this case air). Very light objects are slowed by air resistance, like feathers or thin sheets of paper. This is because their gravitational force is very small compared to the air resistance. Very large objects are also slowed by air resistance. This explains why a parachute slows your fall. Before you open a parachute air resistance is small. After opening, the wide parachute experiences greater air resistance which then slows you down.</p>

<p>It is very important that learners understand the difference between mass and weight. In science, weight is a force, but learners are used to using the word "weight" when describing their mass. Weight is the force experienced by an object due to gravity. On Earth, all objects are attracted downwards towards the centre of the Earth and our weight is an indication of the size of that attraction. Weight will vary depending on our position in space but our mass should remain constant regardless of our position.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>You have probably heard the term 'weight' used many times before, either in your Natural Sciences classroom, or in conversation with others. Many people use the term weight incorrectly in everyday language. For example, a relative may say to you "My weight increased by 2 kgs over the holiday period as I ate too much food." What is wrong with this statement? Discuss this with your class and teacher.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This statement is incorrect as the relative is equating her/his weight with kilograms. Kilograms are a measure of mass, not weight. Her mass might have increased by 2 kilograms.</p>

<p>The word mass comes from the Greek word <em>maza</em> which means a lump of dough or cake.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>mass</strong> of an object is the amount of matter in the object. It tells you how many particles you have. Do you remember learning about atoms in Matter and Materials? So, for example, the mass of a wooden block tells us how many atoms there are. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and is independent of where you measure it. A wooden block with a mass of 10 kg on Earth also has a mass of 10 kg on the Moon.</p>

<p>However, an object's <strong>weight</strong> can change as it depends on the mass of the object and also the strength of the gravitational force acting on it. Weight is measured in newtons (N) as it is the gravitational force of attraction exerted on an object by the Earth (or Moon or any other planet). Therefore, the weight of an object will change when weighed in different places. The weight of a 10 kg block on Earth will be different to that on the Moon. Why do you think this is? Will the weight be more or less than on the Moon? </p><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The Earth is much larger than the Moon and so the gravitational force between the Earth and the block will be greater than the force between the Moon and the block.</p>

<p>You may need to remind the learners about calculating the gradient of a straight line. They should have covered this topic in Mathematics but it would be useful to remind them. They need to choose two co-ordinates on their straight line. They can choose any two coordinates which should be labelled as (x1 ; y1) and (x2 ; y2). The formula for the gradient of a straight line is gradient = rise/run = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)</p>

<p>Example calculation: gradient = (9,8 - 4,8)/(1 - 0.5) = 9,8</p>

<p>Learners may not get the correct answer for the gradient if they have not plotted correctly or if the spring balances are not calibrated properly. They may get an answer closer to 10. The gradient of the graph gives the gravitational acceleration on Earth. This will be explained in the text after the investigation.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>

<p>Write a conclusion for this investigation.</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The weight of an object is directly proportional to the object's mass.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>Weight is the force of gravity pulling you towards the centre of the Earth. It is measured in newtons. On Earth the gravitational force causes us all to accelerate towards the centre of the Earth. The acceleration is called <strong>gravitational acceleration</strong>. On Earth it is 9,8 m/s<sup>2</sup>. The gradient that we calculated in the last investigation should have given you a number close to 9,8 m/s<sup>2</sup> which is gravitational acceleration.</p>

<p>Objects are in <strong>free-fall</strong> when the only force acting on them is the gravitational force.</p>

<p>Weight (W) is calculated by multiplying an object's mass (m) by the gravitational acceleration (g):</p>

<p>W = m &#215; g</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We used this formula in the last section on friction to calculate the weight and therefore the normal force acting on an object.</p>
</div>
<p>But what if you went to the Moon?</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0042.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The Moon is 6 times smaller than the Earth.</figcaption></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The mass of the Earth is 5.972 &#215; 10<sup>24</sup> kg.</p>
</div>
<p>The Moon also has its own gravity. The strength of gravity on the surface of the Moon is one-sixth that on the surface of the Earth, and so you would weigh one-sixth of what you do on Earth on the Moon. On Jupiter you would weigh 2.5 times more than you do on Earth as Jupiter's gravity is 2.5 times that of the Earth's. Even though you would weigh different amounts (and feel lighter on the Moon and heavier on Jupiter) your actual mass would stay the same in both cases.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0043.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An astronaut's mass remains the same wherever it is measured. The astronaut's weight however depends on where you measure it, as you can see the astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth but only 200 N on the Moon.</figcaption></figure><p>So how much would you weigh on the Moon? Imagine you have a mass of 60 kg. Your weight on Earth would be 60 x 9,8 = 588 N. The gravitational acceleration on the Moon is 1,6 m/s<sup>2</sup>, so your weight would be 60 x 1,6 = 96 N on the Moon.</p>

<p>This is an <strong>optional</strong> activity. In this activity, learners calculate what their weight would be on the seven other planets in our solar system. Although their mass remains the same, they will "feel" lighter or heavier because of the differences in the gravitational field strength on the surfaces of the other planets. You should emphasise that their mass always remains the same, but only their weight varies. If you do not have access to weighing scales you can either ask learners to estimate their mass or provide them with an example number.</p>

<p>The weight of a person is the force of gravitational attraction to the Earth that person experiences. Someone in free-fall feels weightless but they have not lost their weight. They are still experiencing the Earth's gravitational attraction.</p>

<p>The only reason the astronauts float is because they are in free-fall and their moving spacecraft is also in free-fall with them, falling at the same rate. Therefore, the astronauts appear to float when compared with the spacecraft because they are both falling at the same rate.</p>

<p><strong>A note on Weightlessness</strong></p>

<p>The term weightless causes a lot of confusion for learners. The confusion of a person's actual weight with one's feeling of weight is the source of many misconceptions. Weightlessness refers only to someone's sensation of their weight, or lack thereof. Weightlessness is a feeling experienced by someone when there are no external objects touching the person exerting a push or pull upon them, (we call these contact forces because they arise due to things being in contact or touching each other).</p>

<p>The weight of a person is the force of gravitational attraction to the Earth that person experiences. Someone in free-fall, feels weightless but they have not lost their weight. They are still experiencing the Earth's gravitational attraction.</p>

<p>Learners are also often confused as to why astronauts in orbit around the Earth float in their spacecraft. One common misconception is that there is no gravity in space and so the astronauts can float. In actual fact, in low Earth orbit the Earth's gravity is about 90% of its strength at the surface of Earth. The only reason the astronauts float is because they are in free-fall and their spacecraft is also in free-fall with them, falling at the same rate. Therefore, the astronauts appear to float when compared with the spacecraft because they are both falling at the same rate. Another example is how orbiting spacecraft are essentially in free-fall as there is 'nothing' retarding their motion towards to centre of the Earth, but because of their orbital velocity, they never actually move closer to the Earth.</p>

<p>A great link to a video of someone experiencing free-fall is given in the Visit box.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong></p>

<p>What can you conclude from your results?</p>

<p>Not all materials are magnetic. Only some metals are magnetic, such as iron.</p>

<p/>
</div>

<p>Not all metals are attracted to magnets. Those that are attracted to magnets are known as <strong>magnetic</strong> materials. There are very few magnetic materials. They are iron, nickel and cobalt. Alloys which include any of the magnetic materials can also be attracted to magnets. Steel is an alloy which contains iron so steel can be attracted to a magnet.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>An alloy is a mixture of metals.</p>
</div>
<p>So now we know that magnetic forces can act over a distance, but can they still act if there is something in the way? Let's find out.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Can a magnetic force act through substances?</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Magnetic forces are non-contact forces and can act over a distance. However, normal magnets do not have very strong magnetic fields. The further an object is from the magnet, the weaker the force experienced. A magnet should be able to act through most substances. If the object placed between the magnet and the metal is too thick, then the metal might be too far away from the magnet to experience a strong enough force. This lack of attraction is then due to the strength of the magnetic field and not the "blocking" ability of the material. In this investigation you can investigate this by using a thin piece of wood and a thick piece of wood. The magnetic field can act through the thin wood which means wood is not a "blocker" of magnetic force. So if the thick wood prevents the paper clips from being attracted it can be seen that it is the distance between the paperclips and the magnet which is relevant and not the material (wood).</p>

<p>The magnet should work through any of the materials, as long as they are thin enough. It is the distance between the magnet and the paper clips that will affect the attraction.

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>It acts over a distance. It is strongest closer to the magnet and weaker as you move further away from the magnet.</p>

<p>In the last activity we saw that like poles repel each other but opposite poles attract each other. We have also seen that the magnetic force acts over a distance. The magnet does not need to touch something in order to exert a force on it. So a magnetic force is a non-contact or a field force.</p>

<p>What is a force field? Can we see it? Let's investigate if it is possible to see a magnetic field.</p>

<p>As we have seen, it is possible to visualise the magnetic force field around a magnet. We know from our previous activities that the magnetic force acts over a distance. The field is the space around a magnet in which it can attract or repel another magnet.</p>

The pattern you saw with your magnets can be represented by <strong>field lines</strong>. Field lines are used to show something we can't actually see.

The field lines go from the north pole to the south pole. The following diagram shows the field lines around a bar magnet.</p>

<p>Did you know that the Earth is like a bar magnet with a North and a South Pole? The Earth has a magnetic field. You can imagine Earth's magnetic field as though there is a bar magnet running through the core with the magnet's south pole under Earth's North Pole. No one knows for sure, but the theory is that the superhot liquid iron in the Earth's core moves in a rotational pattern, and these rotational forces lead to the weak magnetic forces around the Earth's rotational axis.</p>

<p>This is why we can use compasses to tell direction. A plotting compass has a needle with a small magnet. The needle points to magnetic north because the small magnet is attracted to the opposite magnetic field and can be used to determine direction.</p>

<p>Let's look at the example of brushing your hair in more detail to understand what is happening. You have dragged the surface of the plastic comb against the surfaces of your hair. When two surfaces are rubbed together there is <strong>friction</strong> between them. The friction between two surfaces can cause electrons to be transferred from one surface to the other.</p>

<p>In order to understand how electrons can be transferred, we need to remember what we learnt about the structure of an atom.</p>

<p>Where are the electrons positioned in the atom?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The electrons are positioned in the space around the nucleus.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What is the type of charge on a proton?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Positive charge.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What is the type charge on an electron?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Negative charge.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What is the charge on a neutron?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Neutrons are not charged. They are neutral.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The atom is held together by the <strong>electrostatic attraction</strong> between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons. Within an atom, the electrons closest to the nucleus are the most strongly held, whilst those further away experience a weaker attraction.</p>

<p>Normally, atoms contain the same number of protons and electrons. This means that atoms are normally <strong>neutral</strong> because they have the same number of positive and negative charges, so the charges balance each other out. All objects are made up of atoms and since atoms are normally neutral, objects are also usually neutral.</p>

<p>However, when we rub two surfaces together, like when you comb your hair or rub a balloon against your hair, the friction can cause electrons to be transferred from one object to another. Remember, the protons are fixed in place in the nucleus and so they cannot be transferred between atoms. Only electrons can be transferred between atoms. Some objects give up electrons more easily than other objects. Look at the following diagram which explains how this happens.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm5036032"><img src="images/gr9ec01-gd-0059.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Which object gave up some of its electrons in the diagram?</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Does this object now have more positive or more negative charges?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It has more positive charges.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Does this object now have more positive or more negative charges?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p/>
</div>
<p>When an object has more electrons than protons, we say that the object is <strong>negatively charged</strong>.</p>

<p>When an object has fewer electrons than protons, we say that the object is <strong>positively charged</strong>.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Remember it is only the outer electrons which move, and not the protons which are located in the nucleus of the atom.</p>

<p>We now understand the transfer of electrons that takes place as a result of friction between objects. But how did that result in your hair rising when you brought the charged balloon close to your hair in the last activity? Let's look at what happens when oppositely charged objects are brought together.</p>

<p>This is a fun demonstration of how like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. If you have enough materials, allow the learners to try this themselves. If you don't have enough materials, do this as a demonstration but give the learners a chance to play a bit.</p>

<p>When we rubbed the perspex rods with the cloth, electrons were transferred from the perspex to the cloth. What charge do the perspex rods now have?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A positive charge.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Both the perspex rods now have the <strong>same</strong> charge. Did you notice that objects with the same charge tend to push each other away? We say that they are <strong>repelling</strong> each other. It is an electrostatic force of repulsion.</p>

<p>When we rubbed the plastic rod with the cloth, electrons were transferred from the cloth to the plastic rod. What charge does the plastic rod now have?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A negative charge.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>The perspex rod and the plastic rod now have <strong>opposite</strong> charges. Did you notice that objects with different charges tend to pull each other together? We say that they are <strong>attracting</strong> each other. It is an electrostatic force of attraction.</p>

<p>As with gravitational and magnetic force, the distance between charged objects affects the strength of the electrostatic force. The closer the charged objects are, the stronger the force. The more charged the objects are, the stronger the electrostatic force between them.</p>

The Van de Graaff generator can be used to demonstrate the effects of an electrostatic charge. The big metal dome at the top becomes positively charged when the generator is turned on. When the dome is charged it can be discharged by bringing another insulated metal sphere close to the dome. The electrons will jump to the dome from the metal sphere and cause a spark.</p>

<p>The fundamental idea of using friction in a machine to generate a charge dates back to the 17th century, but the generator was only invented by Robert Van de Graaff in 1929 at Princeton University.</p>

<p>How to survive a lightning strike.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/GS5BTm">bit.ly/GS5BTm</a></p>
</div>
<p>During a lightning storm, clouds become charged. Friction between the clouds and the moisture in the clouds cause the clouds to become charged. The bottom of the clouds (closest to the ground) become negatively charged and the top of the cloud becomes positively charged. When the build-up of charge becomes too large, the electrons move from the bottom of the cloud to the ground where they are "earthed". The energy transfer is massive and results in extremely bright light, heat and sound. A lightning flash is a massive discharge between charged regions within clouds, or between clouds and the Earth. The thunder-clap, which we hear, is the air moving as a result of electrons moving.</p>

<p>Lightning is extremely dangerous. If the electrons move through a person on their way to the ground, then the large amounts of energy cause significant damage. That person can suffer serious injury, even death.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>South Africa has one of the highest incidences of lightning strikes in the world.</p>
</div>
<p>What precautions should we take during a lightning storm? Lightning can strike far from the rain shadow of the storm. This means that even if the storm seems to be far away, it is better to take precautions anyway. The safest place to be in a lightning storm is indoors. Stay away from windows and metal objects. If you cannot get inside, avoid standing next to tall objects or metal objects because if lightning strikes it will usually hit the tallest object in the area. If you are travelling in a car during a storm, stay inside the car until the storm subsides.</p>
</div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-14">Summary</h2><div class="note col-md-10" data-type="keyconcepts"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>A force is defined as a push or a pull on an object.</li>
<li>Forces are measured in newtons (N).</li>
<li>A force can change the shape, direction and motion of an object.</li>
<li>Forces act in pairs. The force acting on the object is called the action and the force that the object exerts back in the opposite direction and equal in magnitude is the reaction.</li>
<li>More than one force can act on an object. The net or resultant force is the sum of all the forces acting on the object.</li>
<li>The forces acting on a body can be represented as a free-body diagram where the arrows indicate the direction and magnitude of the different forces.</li>
<li>There are two main groups of forces; contact and non-contact (field) forces.</li>
<li>Contact forces act when objects are in contact (touching) with each other. Friction, tension and compression are examples of contact forces.</li>
<li>Friction is the force opposing motion between two surfaces as they rub against each other.</li>
<li>Compression forces are two forces acting on one object, moving in opposite directions (towards each other) to compress or deform the object.</li>
<li>Tension forces are two forces acting on one object, moving in opposite directions (away from each other) to stretch the object.</li>
<li>Non-contact forces can act over a distance and objects do not have to be touching each other. Common examples of field forces are magnetic, electrostatic and gravitational forces.</li>
<li>Non-contact forces are known as field forces. A field is a region in space where a certain object with certain properties will experience a force.</li>
<li>Gravitational force is a force of attraction between two bodies due to their mass. The gravitational force increases with mass and decreases with the distance between the bodies.</li>
<li>The weight of a body is the gravitational force exerted on an object by the Earth (or Moon or other planet). The weight will vary depending on where it is measured.</li>
<li>The mass of an object is a measure of how much matter it contains. The mass stays constant no matter where it is determined.</li>
<li>
<p>Weight is calculated as W = m &#215; g, where g is the gravitational acceleration. On Earth, g = 9,8m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>A magnet is a material which has a strong magnetic field around it.</li>
<li>Magnetic forces of attraction exist between a magnet and a magnetic substance, such as iron, steel, cobalt and nickel.</li>
<li>A magnet has two poles, a north and south pole. Opposite poles attract each other and like poles repel each other.</li>
<li>The Earth has a magnetic field around it. We can use compasses to tell direction as the needle is a magnet which points to magnetic North.</li>
<li>When certain materials are rubbed together, the friction between them causes electrons to move from one material to the other. The objects then have an electrostatic charge, due to either the loss or gain of electrons.</li>
<li>A charge is a fundamental property of matter. Electrons carry negative charges and protons carry positive charges.</li>
<li>An object which has gained electrons will be negatively charged. An object which has lost electrons will be positively charged.</li>
<li>There is an electrostatic force of attraction between objects with opposite charges, and repulsion between objects with like charges.</li>
<li>Thunder clouds can become charged as the water and air particles rub against each other. A lightning strike occurs when there is a huge discharge between the thunderclouds and the ground.</li>
<li>Lightning is dangerous and safety precautions should be adhered to during lightning storms.</li>

<p>You do an experiment in class to investigate the bar magnets. You place two magnets next to each other on the table and place a sheet of paper over the magnets and sprinkle iron filings over the paper. You then turn one magnet around and do it again. You see the following patterns. What does each photo (A and B) show us? [2 marks]</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The girls are touching the hollow dome of a Van de Graaff generator. The dome is positively charged so electrons are transferred from their bodies to the dome to discharge it. This causes their bodies and hair to become positively charged. Their hair strands now repel each other as they are all positive (like charges repel) and they rise up.</p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Friction between the water and air particles in the clouds causes a build-up of negative charge. When there is a large excess charge in the clouds, the excess charge moves through the air to the ground and discharges. This discharge forms a bright spark as the energy which is released by the moving charges is in the form of heat, light and sound. This is lightning.</p>

<p>The learners are playing outside during a lightning storm, which is dangerous. Furthermore, they are underneath a tree, which is even more dangerous as the lightning strikes tall objects, such as trees, and so they are at risk of getting shocked.</p>
