<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>This chapter starts off by explaining the meaning of resistance in an electric circuit. Learners will then look at the use of resistors. This is a revision of some of the concepts covered in Gr 8 Energy and Change when looking at the <em>Energy transfers within an electrical system</em> (Chapter 2). For an easy reference to what learners covered in the previous grade, you can visit the website <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.curious.org.za">www.curious.org.za</a> where this content is located online, and navigate to the relevant grade and chapter.</p>

<p>This year, the concept of resistance will be extended by looking at the factors that affect resistance in a resistor, namely:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the type of material of which the conductor is made</li>
<li>the thickness of the conductor</li>
<li>the length of the conductor</li>
<li>the temperature of the conductor</li>
</ul><p>These will be investigated experimentally. Learners must be able to explain the relationships between these factors and the resistance offered by the resistor. It is not necessary to show experimentally how temperature affects resistance, but the concept must still be covered. CAPS suggests investigating at least one of the other factors. All three investigations have been included in this workbook so that you have the choice as to which one you would like to conduct with your class, or, if time permits, you can conduct all three investigations. Three hours have been allocated to this section in CAPS, so you should have time to perform more than one of the investigations. In the workbook, they have been presented as three separate investigations, but you can also perform them concurrently, or allocate a different investigation to different groups. The groups can then report back to the class on their findings and you can subsequently summarise the effects on the board.</p>

<p>If you only teach Natural Sciences, it is a good idea to check with the Technology teachers to see how these two curriculums complement each other, especially with regard to electricity. Some of the concepts which might be introduced for the first time in Natural Sciences, have already been covered in the Technology curriculum. Knowing what learners have already covered and been introduced to will help make your classes more efficient and more stimulating for learners.</p>

<p>A good way to introduce this topic is to act out the following situation with your learners which is explained in the learner's book. You can even just create an imaginary field by drawing a square with chalk on the ground and then a narrow corridor coming off of it. Tell learners to first walk around randomly in the field and then when you signal (indicating that a potential difference has been applied across the wire), they all need to move towards the corridor and get through it. You can make the corridor start off wide and become narrower to further illustrate how the resistance to their movement increases as the corridor becomes narrower. This only demonstrates one of the factors influencing resistance (namely the width of the conductor), but can be used to introduce the idea of resistance.</p>

<p>We have revised the concept of electric current and how electrons move within a conducting wire before introducing the idea of resistance in an electric circuit.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Think about your school break time. All of the learners are outside on the field, sitting in groups and relaxing. Some of you will be moving around the field from group to group as you greet your friends. The school bell rings, signaling the end of break. You all get up and start moving toward the school building. You are all able to move easily because there is a great deal of space but what happens as you enter the corridor of the school building?</p>
<figure id="gd-idm7300144"><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0001.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Everyone now has to fit through a narrow corridor. Everyone is trying to get to class and so some learners will bump into other learners. As you try to enter your classroom it becomes even more difficult because the doorway is even narrower than the corridor and so only one or two learners can pass through at a time.</p>

<p>The movement of the learners is very similar to the movement of electrons in an electrical conductor. The field offers a very low resistance to the movement of the learners and so the learners are able to move freely. The corridor has a higher resistance to the movement of the learners because less learners can now pass through the corridor than through the field. The classroom doorway offers the highest resistance as it only allows a few learners through at a time.</p>

<p>How can we use this to illustrate <strong>electrical resistance</strong>? Let's first revise some concepts about electric current.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p><strong>Electric charge</strong>, or charge, is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when close to other electrically charged matter. There are two types of electric charges - positive and negative. Electrons have a negative charge and protons have a positive charge.</p>
</div>
<p>An electric current is the rate of charge flow in a closed, electric circuit. The electrons in an atom are arranged in the outer space around the central nucleus. In metals, the electrons are able to move freely within the metal. The electrons are not associated with a particular atom in the metal. We say electrons in a metal are <strong>delocalised</strong>. Have a look at the following diagram which shows this.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We can think of the model of a metal as the positive metal ions in fixed positions surrounded by a 'sea' of electrons.</p>
</div><figure id="gd-idp8117248"><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Conducting wire in an electric circuit is made of metal. If we supply it with a source of energy and a complete circuit, then the electrons will all move in the same general direction through the wire to the positive terminal of the battery. This movement of electrons per time through a conductor is the <strong>electric current</strong>.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm532832"><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0003.png" width="300"/></figure><p><strong>Resistance</strong> in an electrical circuit opposes the passage of electrons. The unit of measurement for resistance is the <strong>ohm</strong>, with the symbol &#937;.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The ohm gets its name from the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm, who noticed that the potential difference across a conductor and the electric current are directly proportional (Ohm's Law).</p>
</div>
<p>Do you remember what an electrical conductor is? Write your own definition below.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>An electrical conductor is a type of material or object which allows electric charge to pass through it.</p>

<p>You can also remind learners at this point that electrical insulators are non-conductors as they do not allow electric charge through them.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>All electrical conductors have some resistance. Some conducting materials have a particular resistance and are used to add electrical resistance to a circuit. An electrical component which adds resistance to a circuit is called a <strong>resistor.</strong></p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0004.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Different types of resistors used to add resistance to an electric circuit.</figcaption></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Can you see that there are different coloured bands on the resistors? This isn't just to make them look pleasing to the eye. The coloured bands are actually a code that tells us the strength of the resistance of the resistor.</p>
</div>
<p>Resistors are electrical components and have a symbol to represent them in an electric circuit diagram. Do you remember the symbol from Gr 8? Draw it in the space below.</p>

<p><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>There are two symbols used to represent resistors, but the one most commonly used is the the one using a block.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm3811056"><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0005.png" width="300"/></figure><figure id="gd-idm722016"><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0006.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>
</div>
<p>On a microscopic level, electrons moving through the conductor collide (or interact) with the particles of which the conductor (metal) is made. When they collide, they transfer kinetic energy. This leads to resistance. The transferred energy causes the resistor to heat up. You can feel this directly if you touch a cellphone charger when you are charging a cell phone - the charger gets warm because its circuits have some resistors in them.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-2">Uses of resistors</h2><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>LED</li>
<li>motor</li>
<li>variable resistance</li>
<li>rheostat</li>
<li>Sankey diagram</li>
<li>input energy</li>
<li>output energy</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Resistors can be used to control the current in a circuit. Think back to some of the work that you did in Gr 8. If you increase the resistance in a circuit, what happens to the current? Explain your answer.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Discuss this with your class as they might not have conducted these investigations in the previous grade. When the resistance in a circuit increases, the current decreases. Adding more resistance increases the opposition to the flow of charge so it is more difficult for charge to move through the circuit. Therefore there is less current (as current is the rate of flow of charge). We say that the current is inversely proportional to the resistance, meaning as the resistance increases, the current decreases.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Another way in which we can use resistors is to provide useful energy transfers. Do you remember looking at energy transfers in a system in Gr 8? The <strong>input energy</strong> enters the system and then provides an <strong>output energy</strong>. Some of the output energy is useful to us, and some is wasted energy. For example, a resistor can be used to transfer electrical energy into light (light bulb) or into heat (kettle element). Energy is wasted as it is lost to the surroundings. Resistors are used to provide useful energy transfers.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Useful resistance</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This activity links back to the work done in Grade 8 Energy and Change. The difference between "useful" and "wasted" energy is highlighted again. The learners should see that resistors can be used to provide useful energy transfers.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Why do we want to resist the movement of electrons? Resistors can be extremely useful. Think about a kettle. If you look inside you will see a large metal coil.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0007.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Looking inside a kettle.</figcaption></figure><p>This metal coil is the heating element. If you plug in and switch on the kettle, the element heats up and heats the water. The element is a large resistor. When the electrons move through the resistor, they release a lot of energy in overcoming the resistance. This energy is transferred to the water in the form of heat. This transfer of energy is useful to us as the thermal energy is used to boil water in the kettle.</p>

<p>Look at the photograph of a light bulb on the left. Can you see there is a small coiled wire in the glass bulb? This is called the filament. The filament is made from tungsten wire. This is an element with high resistance.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0008.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An incandescent light bulb.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/antonfomkin/3045744275/">[link]</a></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0009.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The tungsten filament glowing brightly.</figcaption></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">

<p>The first electric light was made in 1800 by a man called Humphry Davy. He invented an electric battery, to which he connected wires and a piece of carbon. Being a resistor, the carbon glowed and produced light.</p>

<p>Rheostats are another form of resistor which are commonly used. A <strong>rheostat</strong> is a device which is able to offer a <strong>variable</strong> resistance. Rheostats are used in electric circuits where you want to adjust the current, for example in sound equipment to adjust the volume, in dimmer switches for lights and in controlling the speed of <strong>motors</strong>. Let's look at how rheostats can be used in a circuit.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0011.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">An example of a rheostat.</figcaption></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>The rheostat (video).<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/19OxkLB">bit.ly/19OxkLB</a></p>
</div><div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Make your own rheostat</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If you have rheostats in your laboratory then you may choose to simply demonstrate how the resistance is varied by changing the position of the slider. The position of the slider affects the length of the resistor coil. Because length is a factor which affects resistance, the shorter the coil, the less resistance; the longer the coil, the greater the resistance.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>graphite rod or graphite pencil</li>
<li>torch light bulb</li>
<li>battery (AA)</li>
<li>insulated copper conducting wires with crocodile clips</li>
<li>ammeter</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If you do not have a graphite rod then a graphite pencil can be used. Sharpen the pencil on both sides and carve the wood from the pencil at various points along the length of the pencil. This is easier than trying to remove the entire graphite rod from the pencil. The graphite is soft and often breaks into pieces if you try to remove the entire thing.</p>

<p>The ammeter is not strictly necessary. If you do not have one, then the learners can use the brightness of the bulb as an indication of the strength of the current.</p>

<p/>

<p>The graphite rod was behaving as a rheostat. The resistance of the graphite rod was changed by changing the length connected to the circuit. A dimmer switch often has a dial which can be turned. Turning the dial increases the resistance of the circuit and makes the light dim. Why do you think this happens?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>When the resistance is increased, the current decreases, and so the brightness of the bulb decreases.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Turning the dial in the opposite direction causes the resistance to decrease and so the light burns brighter. Turning the dial changes the resistance of the rheostat in the switch.</p>

<p>Another device which demonstrates the useful application of resistance is in an <strong>LED</strong>. LED stands for light emitting diode.</p>

<p>A diode is an electrical component that has a very low resistance to current flow in one direction, and high resistance in the other direction. Therefore, current can only move in one direction.</p>
</div>
<p>An LED is a diode because it only allows current to pass through it in one direction. This means that it has to be put into a circuit in a very specific way. LEDs are very sensitive to high currents so when they are connected in a circuit, they need to be protected by a large resistor. The resistor is used to control the current which is allowed to travel through the LED. This is another useful application of resistance.</p>

<p>Many households are choosing to replace incandescent light bulbs with LEDs. Are LEDs a more efficient form of lighting?</p>

<p>We can use a <strong>Sankey diagram</strong> to show how the energy is transferred in a system. This gives us a picture of what is happening and shows the input energy and how the output energy is made up of useful energy (arrow at the top) and wasted energy (arrow going to the bottom). Have a look at the following general example.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp4576864"><img src="images/gr9ec03-gd-0016.png" width="300"/></figure><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Sankey diagrams are named after the Irish Captain Matthew Sankey, who first used this type of diagram in 1898 in a publication on the energy efficiency of a steam engine.</p>
</div>
<p>The width of the arrows tell us something in these diagrams. The input energy is the width of the original arrow. The width of both the output energy arrows (useful and wasted) add up to the width of the input arrow. Why do you think this is so?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This is because energy is neither created nor destroyed, but conserved within a system. So the input must equal the output energy in a system.</p>

</div>
<p>Sankey diagrams are drawn to scale so that the width of the arrows gives us a visual idea of how much energy is useful and how much is wasted.</p>

<p>When we built our own rheostat, we were able to vary the resistance by changing the length of the graphite rod. This tells us that the length of the rod affected the amount of resistance. Let's look at what other factors which affect the resistance of a conductor.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Factors that affect resistors</h2>
<p>What determines the resistance of a component? Let's investigate some of the factors. There are 4 different factors which affect resistance:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The type of material of which the resistor is made</li>
<li>The length of the resistor</li>
<li>The thickness of the resistor</li>
<li>The temperature of the conductor</li>
</ul><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-4">Type of material</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is not necessary to test each of the factors which affect resistance. Testing the type of material is the easiest method for the learners to pursue in class. As an extension, you could have the learners do a small project on how the cross-sectional area of the material affects resistance or how temperature affects resistance.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Conductors can be made of different materials. Do different materials have different resistances?</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">How does the material of the resistor affect the resistance?</h1>
<p>How can we measure the resistance? Do you remember that in a series circuit, if we increase the resistance, then the strength of the current decreases? This means that we can use the strength of the current in the circuit as an indication of the amount of resistance in the circuit.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">

<p>The thinner the wire, the more resistance it offers. Thicker wires offer less resistance. This is easy to understand if you think back to the example of all the learners filing back into the classrooms after break. If the corridor is narrow (or thin) then it is harder for all the learners to move through. A very wide corridor would be easier to move through as it offers less resistance. This is the same in a conducting wire. A thinner wire is more difficult for electrons to move through than a thicker wire.</p>

<p><strong>Optional, online simulation:</strong></p>

<p>If you have access to the internet for your students then you can do the activities listed in this subsection. The simulation referred to in the activity can be found here <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1cXLK35">bit.ly/1cXLK35</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, the PhET simulation for investigating resistance in a wire listed in the visit box can also be used.</p>

<p>The simulation opens by showing the value of the resistance of a 50 cm length of 26 SWG constantan wire as being 1,585 ohms. This resistance is given to three decimal places and shown in the yellow area of the display screen. There is a reset button at the top of the screen which will set the simulation back to the resistance of a 50 cm length of 26 SWG constantan wire.</p>

<p>There are various sliders on the screen where you can adjust the length, material type and cross-sectional area of the resistor.

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong></p>

<p>As the diameter of the wire increases, the resistance <strong>decreases</strong>. In fact, if we double the cross-sectional area then the resistance <strong>halves</strong>. This means that resistance is <strong>inversely</strong> proportional to the area of the wire.</p>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong> Write a hypothesis for this investigation.</p>

<p>A possible hypothesis is: The longer the length of the conductor, the higher the resistance.</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND APPARATUS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>piece of resistance wire (110cm) long</li>
<li>ammeter</li>
<li>two 1,5 V cells</li>
<li>metre ruler</li>
<li>tape</li>
<li>insulated copper conducting wires</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The wire must be without any insulation. Copper wire often has varnish as insulation and therefore will not work. Nichrome or constantan wire work well (between 28 and 32 SWG - the SWG rating indicates the cross-sectional area of the wire). Other wires can also be used. The length is a suggestion only. If you are only able to obtain smaller lengths, the learners will take fewer readings. If you do not have an ammeter then use a light bulb as an indicator of current strength. You want about 3 V for this circuit so any combination of cells which provide 3 V would work, or a low voltage power supply.</p>

<p/>

<p>The graph should have the independent variable (length) on the x-axis and the dependent variable (ammeter reading) on the y-axis. The graph should show that as the length of the resistance wire increases, the ammeter reading decreases. It is unlikely to be a straight line. Learners must provide a heading, such as "Graph showing the change in current in a circuit as the length of a conducting wire is varied."</p>

<p>As an extension, learners can rather calculate the resistance using the formula R = V/I and then plot resistance versus length directly.</p>

<p><strong>Optional, online simulation:</strong></p>

<p>If you have access to the internet for your students then you can do an online simulation. The simulation referred to in the activity can be found here <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1cXLK35">bit.ly/1cXLK35</a></p>

<p>Alternatively, the PhET simulation for investigating resistance in a wire listed in the previous visit box can also be used.</p>

<p>The simulation opens by showing the value of the resistance of a 50 cm length of 26 SWG constantan wire as being 1,585 ohms. This resistance is given to three decimal places and shown in the yellow area of the display screen. There is a reset button at the top of the screen which will set the simulation back to the resistance of a 50 cm length of 26 SWG constantan wire.</p>

<p>There are various sliders on the screen where you can adjust the length, material type and cross-sectional area of the resistor. Take some time to familiarise yourself with the simulation before allowing the learners to use the simulation. Here is an example of the investigation you could do.</p>

<p><strong>Investigation: How does the length of the wire affect the resistance of the wire ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>

<p>As the length of the wire increases, the resistance <strong>increases</strong>. In fact, if we double the length then the resistance <strong>doubles</strong>. This means that resistance is directly <strong>proportional</strong> to the length of the wire.</p>

We want to fit a very long wire into a small space. The electrons have to travel through this very long, high-resistance wire. How is this more beneficial compared to having a shorter wire? Discuss this with your class.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A longer wire increases the resistance. The electrons travelling through the wire therefore transfer a lot of energy to the wire in the form of heat and light. A shorter wire would not provide as much heat and light.</p>

<p/>
</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-7">Temperature of the conductor</h3><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>We are not going to investigate this factor as it is difficult to control the temperature of a wire in an investigation.</p>
</div>
<p>The last factor which affects resistance is the temperature of the conductor. The hotter a resistor becomes the more resistance it has. The atoms of the conductor vibrate much faster when they are hot due to the increase in kinetic energy. This makes it more difficult for the electric current to move through. Cold resistors offer less resistance to the circuit.</p>
