<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>Learners have already been introduced to series and parallel circuits in Grade 8. However, they will now learn more detail about how the circuits function. They will be introduced to the concept of potential difference. It would be useful to revise some of the investigations covered in the Grade 8 syllabus as activities this year. Some of these activities have been included here in the Gr 9 workbook again. You can easily access the Gr 8 content online at <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.curious.org.za">www.curious.org.za</a>. This will help learners to remember and revise the concepts that they learned a full year ago. If you feel that learners already grasp these concepts, then rather spend more time on the investigations. As an extension, you can do more calculations in class. Some calculations have been included here, such as calculating resistance given the potential difference and current.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>In CAPS, the term 'voltage' is predominantly used, however, here in these workbooks, the term 'potential difference' is rather used as this is the correct scientific term to use. Potential difference is also the term used in FET level and beyond.</p>

<p>If you only teach Natural Sciences, it is a good idea to check with the Technology teachers to see how these two curriculums complement each other, especially with regard to electricity. Some of the concepts which might be introduced for the first time in Natural Sciences, have already been covered in the Technology curriculum. Knowing what learners have already covered and been introduced to will help make your classes more efficient and more stimulating for learners.</p>

<p>A useful device to use in the investigations and activities in this chapter is a multimeter. Find out more about multimeters and how to use them in this video: <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/16qtjg6">bit.ly/16qtjg6</a> Remember that you just need to type this link into the address bar in your internet browser and press enter, in order to access the video.</p>

<p>You might have learned about potential difference in Technology already, but this is the first time we are investigating it in Natural Sciences.</p>
</div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">What is potential difference?</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>A useful video to watch in order to explain potential difference and current to your learners, in terms of the analogy of a river. This video was not included in the learners book as some of the concepts are beyond the scope of the curriculum at this stage, such as a coulomb of charge. <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/Havmzk">bit.ly/Havmzk</a></p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Some people often use the term<strong>voltage</strong> to describe the potential difference. This is based on the fact that we measure potential difference in <strong>volts</strong>. Voltage is not the scientific term, and potential difference is the more correct term to use.</p>
</div>
<p>Potential difference is the difference in potential energy per charge between two different points in an electric circuit. Here is a simpler explanation: potential difference tells us how much energy per charge the electrons are losing when they pass through a resistor or how much they are gaining when they pass through the cell or battery. The electrons "lose" energy because they have transferred it to the resistor in the form of heat, light or sound. Electrons "gain" energy when they pass through the cell or battery because of the chemical energy from the battery being transferred to the electrons.</p>

<p>The potential difference is measured by a <strong>voltmeter.</strong>The unit of potential difference is the<strong>volt</strong></p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The volt is named in honour of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), who invented the voltaic pile, the first electric battery which could deliver a continuous electric current.</p>
</div><figure><img src="images/gr9ec04-gd-0003.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A voltmeter.</figcaption></figure><p>The voltmeter has a very high internal resistance and must be connected in parallel with the component you are measuring. You therefore need to connect it to two different points (which are usually, before and after a resistor). The voltmeter calculates the potential difference between those two points. An example illustrating the placement of a voltmeter at two points, (A and B) is indicated in the diagram below.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec04-gd-0004.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">This voltmeter is connected in parallel with the bulb and measures the potential difference between points A and B.</figcaption></figure><p>If you connect the voltmeter in series, there will not be two different points as you connect it to the same wire with the same potential difference. What do you think would happen if you connected the voltmeter in series in the circuit? Explain your answer.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This would affect the current in the circuit as the voltmeter provides a very high resistance so the current would not flow through the circuit, or there would be a very small current.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What do we use to measure the current in a circuit?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>An ammeter.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>How do we connect this device into a circuit? Explain why this is so.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The ammeter is connected in series as we need to measure the current so all the current must flow through the ammeter.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Do you think the ammeter has a large or a small resistance? Explain your answer. </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The ammeter has a very small resistance so that it does not oppose the current and affect the reading.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>Draw a circuit diagram in the following space to illustrate an ammeter, a light bulb and a cell connected in a circuit.</p>

<p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The circuit should look as follows with the ammeter in series:</p>

<p>When cells are connected together they are called a battery. What happens when we put more than one cell in a circuit? Let's investigate what happens when we add cells, in series, to a circuit.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>If you do not have sufficient equipment to allow all the learners to attempt these circuits. Use the PhET simulation software which can be obtained from <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/17vBMBX">bit.ly/17vBMBX</a></p>

<p><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc">[link]</a></p>

<p><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc">[link]</a></p>

<p>Before allowing your students to use the PhET simulations there are several things you should familiarise yourself with regarding the software. Make sure you know how to:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>add components to a circuit. You need to click and hold down and drag the components from the side of the screen to where you want them.</li>
<li>connecting components with wires. You can place a wire onto the screen and then drag the ends till they meet up with the component. Make sure that you are careful when connecting light bulbs. The system will create a short circuit if they are not connected correctly. This will require some practice.</li>
<li>delete wires or components or to add parts. You can't just add after the circuit is built, just as in a real circuit you need to disconnect components to make space for new ones. Right-click with the mouse on the junction between two components and it will give you the option to disconnect. Right-click on the component itself, and you will be given the option to remove the entire component.</li>
<li>use the voltmeter and ammeter. The non-contact ammeter is very useful but the other one is more realistic.</li>
<li>clear the image to start something else. Your learners can save their circuits for future use if your lesson is interrupted and then load them again when you need them. If they need a blank screen in order to start again, then click on the "reset all" button.</li>
<li>reset the resistance of a resistor or light bulb or to change the potential difference of a battery. Right-click on the component and you will be given the option to adjust the settings.</li>

<p><strong>INVESTIGATIVE QUESTION:</strong></p>

<p>What is the relationship between the potential difference across the battery and the potential difference across the resistors in a series circuit?</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong></p>

<p>Write a conclusion for this investigation.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The total potential difference across the battery is equal to the sum of the potential differences across each of the resistors. A resistor with a higher resistance will have a higher potential difference.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>What have we learned? The <strong>sum</strong> of the potential differences across the resistors in a series circuit is equal to the potential difference across the battery.</p>

<p>If a resistor has a high resistance then it will have a large potential difference. If a resistor has a low resistance then it will have a small potential difference. We can explain this because the battery provides the electrons with potential energy. The electrons travel through the resistors and lose some of that energy to each resistor in the form of heat, light or sound. There is only one path for the electrons to travel and so they transfer energy to each resistor through which they pass. The higher the resistance of the resistor, the more energy is transferred within the resistor. Therefore, there will be a greater difference in potential energy per charge from before to after the resistor in the series circuit.</p>

<p>Let's look at the following example:</p>
<figure id="gd-idm5932080"><img src="images/gr9ec04-gd-0014.png" width="300"/></figure><p>If the potential difference across the cells or battery is 9 V and the potential difference across one of the bulbs is 4 V, what would the reading on the third voltmeter be?</p>

<p/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The potential differences across the two resistors must add together to give the potential difference across the battery. This means that the missing reading is 9 - 4 = 5 V.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>We say that resistors in series are <strong>potential dividers</strong>.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Check your knowledge of series circuits</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>This activity will allow the learners to practice and test their understanding of the concepts they have learned so far. Let each learner make their own predictions. If you have access to the PhET software, allow each learner to set up the circuits using PhET to test their predictions. If you do not have enough equipment to allow individual learners to build the circuits, either build one set of circuits to demonstrate to the class or allow them to work in small groups. If the learners are in groups, make sure that each learner gets a turn to build a circuit in order to make sure they have the skills to do so.</p>

<p>Learners should be left to make their own predictions without any help. This will also teach them the idea of making predictions (hypotheses) and testing them, the essence of scientific exploration. As a result the predictions will be learner-dependent.</p>

<p>What can we conclude regarding the effect of adding cells in parallel into a circuit?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Connecting more cells in parallel into a circuit does not affect the current strength and the potential difference in the circuit.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p>What have we learned? When we connect two cells in parallel with each other, the overall potential difference is the same as if we only had one cell. Therefore if both cells are 1,5 V, then the overall potential difference for the circuit is still 1,5 V. The current is the same as if there was only one cell because the electrons only travel through one of the cells.</p>

<p>What advantage would we get from connecting cells in this way? Discuss this with your class.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>When we connect cells in parallel we supply alternative pathways for the current to follow. This means that each of the cells last longer than if they were in a series circuit. Also if one cell fails, the circuit will still have another cell.</p>

</div>
<p>When we add resistors in parallel to each other the total resistance decreases and the current increases. Why does this happen? Adding resistors in parallel provides more alternative pathways for the current. Therefore it is easier for current to move through the circuit than if all the current had to move through one resistor.</p>

<p>Imagine that you are sitting in a school hall during assembly. You are bored and waiting for the end so that you can go out to break to chat to your friends. There is only one exit from the hall. When you are dismissed, everyone has to exit through the same door. It takes a while because only some learners can leave at a time.</p>

<p>Now imagine that there is a second door that is the same as the first door. Now you and your friends have a choice of which door to go through. The number of learners that exit the hall together will increase and some of you will exit through the first door while others will exit through the second door. No one can go through both doors at the same time.</p>

<p>This is similar to the way current behaves when in a parallel circuit. As the electrons approach the branch in the circuit, some electrons will take the first path and others will take the other path. The current is divided between the two pathways. We say that resistors in parallel are current dividers. Although both pathways provide resistance, the total resistance is less than if there was just one pathway.</p>

<p>We are now going to look at the potential difference across each resistor in a parallel circuit.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Measuring the potential difference across components in a parallel circuit</h1><div class="teachers-guide">

<p>It would be sensible to use PhET simulations for this investigation due to the large amount of equipment required. If you do not have access to the PhET simulations then it would be a good idea to do this as a demonstration.</p>

<p>This is learner dependent.

</div>
<p>Do you know that we can calculate the resistance of each light bulb in the circuit used in this investigation? We have seen that the current (I) through a resistor is inversely proportional to the resistance ( R) and the potential difference across a resistor (V) is directly proportional to the resistance.</p>

<p>This relationship is summarized in the following equation: R = V/I</p>

<p>The unit of resistance is the ohm (&#937;) which is defined as a volt per amp of current. This can be written as:</p>

<p>1 ohm = 1 volt/amp</p>

<p>We can therefore calculate the resistance. An example is shown here using the values in this circuit diagram:</p>
<figure id="gd-idp6592880"><img src="images/gr9ec04-gd-0042.png" width="300"/></figure><p>R = V/I</p>

<p>= 3 V/ 2A</p>

<p>= 1.5 &#937;</p>

<p>In this investigation, you measured the potential difference (in volts) and the current (in amps) for each bulb. Use these measurements to calculate the resistance for each bulb in your circuit.</p>

<p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p>Which type of circuit, series or parallel would be more useful in a household circuit? Why?</p>

          
<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

          
<p>The parallel circuit would be more useful because light bulbs often break or fuse. If we use a parallel circuit, the rest of the light bulbs and appliances in the house can still function. If we use a series circuit then one broken appliance would mean that everything stops working.</p>

          
<p/>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p>Parallel circuits are useful in household circuits because if one pathway stops working then the other pathways can still work. So if your bathroom light bulb breaks, the rest of the lights or appliances in the house can still be used. If your house used a series circuit then all the lights and appliances in the house would stop working if one item broke. You can also turn lights on in different rooms at different times without having to turn all the lights on in the whole house at once.</p>

<p>An example of a series circuit is a set of tree lights. Each light bulb is connected in series with the others. This means that if even one breaks then all will stop working. To find the broken one and fix it, you would have to test every bulb.</p>

<p>Household circuits are parallel circuits. Explain why it is better to use a parallel circuit in a house than a series circuit? [2 marks]</p>

<p/><p/>

          
<p>This enables you to switch one light on in a room without turning all the lights on. If one part of the parallel circuit breaks then the rest of the circuit can still function as the other pathways are still complete.</p>

<li>
<p>It would show 6 A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When switch S2 is opened, the circuit becomes a series circuit and all the current goes through the one branch, through A2 and so A1 and A2 will show the same reading, 6 A.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bulb A has the higher resistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bulb A has the smaller current which goes through it, and therefore it must have the higher resistance as the larger the resistance, the smaller the current (they are inversely proportional).</p>
</li>
<li> 
<p>This is an extension question as it is not required to be able to calculate resistance. An example was covered in the content.</p>

          
<p>Resistance in Bulb A = V/I = 9/2 = 4.5 &#937;</p>

          
<p>resistance in Bulb B = V/I = 9/4 = 2.25 &#937;</p>
