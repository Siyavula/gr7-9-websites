<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>This chapter revises the work covered in Grades 7 and 8, with an emphasis on nuclear fuel. Try to arrange an excursion to a power plant or ask if an engineer is able to come to the school to explain how the power plant operates and to answer questions posed by the learners. This would provide an opportunity for the learners to ask questions about careers in the electrical industry. Here is a link to the Wikipedia article which lists all the power stations in South Africa.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_South_Africa"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_South_Africa</a><a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_South_Africa"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_power_stations_in_South_Africa</a></p>

<p>Electricity is generated in a power station. In previous grades, we have looked at how electricity is generated within coal-powered power stations and distributed to the country in the national electricity grid. We are going to revise some of these concepts.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>Electricity generation (video).<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/20Vb6hlLQSg"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>The general method for producing electricity is to turn a turbine which will turn a generator. In South Africa most of the power stations use coal for fuel. The coal is mined out of the earth. The coal is transported to the power station in large trucks or trains.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>In Gr 8 you might have made miniature turbines and seen how steam is able to make the blades of the turbine turn. You can refer back to this by looking online at <a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.curious.org.za">www.curious.org.za</a></p>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Do you remember how coal is formed? Coal is a fossil fuel, formed over millions of years as prehistoric swamps and vegetation were covered in layers of sediment and compressed.</p>

</div>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what happens inside a coal-powered power station. Have a look at the following diagram.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp4149808"><img src="images/gr9ec06-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><p>An overview of the steps in a coal-powered station:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p>The large chunks of coal are first crushed into a fine powder. This is called <strong>pulverisation</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coal is then transported to a <strong>furnace</strong> where it is burnt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thermal energy from the burning coal is used to boil water and generate <strong>steam</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The steam pushes the blades of the <strong>turbine</strong> and so the turbine spins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The turbine is connected to the shaft of the <strong>generator</strong> which then rotates large magnets within wire coils, which generates electricity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>electric current</strong> is sent through the <strong>power lines</strong> to businesses and homes.</p>
</li>

<p>Is coal a renewable or non-renewable energy source? Explain your answer.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>It is non-renewable as there is a finite amount and it cannot be replenished.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>What are the disadvantages of South Africa's reliance on coal as the main source of energy in power stations?</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Discuss this with your class. This is revision of what learners have covered in previous grades. The main disadvantages are:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The use of coal is not sustainable as coal is a non-renewable energy source.</li>
<li>The use of coal has serious negative environmental impacts. Burning coal releases greenhouse gases which build up in the atmosphere. This contributes to the formation of acid rain and the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming.</li>

<li>Make a small hole in the center of the plate. Push a pencil through the hole. The pencil should fit tightly into the hole. Use adhesive tape to stick the wheel to the pencil so that if you rotate the pencil, the wheel rotates.</li>
<li>Tie a piece of string around one end of the pencil. Tie the small nut or bolt to the other end of the string.</li>
<li>Hold each end of the pencil lightly between your thumbs and index fingers.</li>
<li>Hold the wheel under a slow stream of water from a running tap. Make sure to hold the wheel so that the blades are in the water, as shown in the diagram.</li>

A generator is a device which converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. A generator consists of large metal coils which move within a magnetic field. In some generators the coils are stationary and the magnet is rotated and in other generators the magnets are stationary and the coil is rotated. Turning a set of conducting metal coils inside a magnetic field generates an electric current.</p>

<p>The modern-day generator works on the principle of electromagnetic induction discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831-32. Faraday discovered that you could cause an electric current to flow by moving an electrical conductor, such as a wire that contains electric charges, in a magnetic field. The movement creates a potential difference between the two ends of the wire or electrical conductor. This then causes the electric charges to flow through the conductor as current.</p>

<p>There are many different types of generators used in different situations, not only in power stations. Some yachts and boats use water or wind-powered generators to charge their batteries through the use of small propellers in the water or a wind turbine. Portable generators are often used in homes and businesses when there are power outages to keep certain appliances running, such as the lights and refrigerator. Portable generators run on fuel, such as petrol, diesel or gasoline to turn the shaft to generate electricity.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Portable generators produce exhaust fumes which contain poisonous gases that can kill if in high enough levels. When using a portable generator, make sure it is in a well-ventilated area, and away from water as much as possible.</p>

<p>Most atomic nuclei are stable. But, there are some elements which are not stable. The nuclei in these unstable elements spontaneously emit particles, which is referred to as radiation. A nucleus that emits radiation is said to be <strong>radioactive</strong>.Radioactive decay is the process when an unstable nucleus of an atom emits particles. It then 'decays' into another type of atom with a different mass.</p>

<p>How nuclear power works.<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LTnfXLws40Q"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p>Nuclear power was first pursued for electricity generation in the beginning of the 20th century when researchers discovered that radioactive materials, such as radium and uranium, release large amounts of energy when they decay. For a long time, however, the use of nuclear power was not seen as practical or possible to generate electricity.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>You might have first learned about nuclear fusion in Gr 8 Planet Earth and Beyond, when looking at where the energy in our Sun comes from.</p>
</div>
<p>This changed in the 1930's with the discovery of <strong>nuclear fission</strong>. During nuclear fission, scientists split the nucleus of an atom into two smaller atoms. This releases a huge amount of energy. There is also another way in which the energy in an atom can be released during nuclear fusion. <strong>Nuclear fusion</strong> is when two atoms are brought together to make a new, bigger atom. During both of these nuclear reactions, huge amounts of heat and radiation are released.</p>

</div>
<p>Nuclear power uses nuclear fission, nuclear fusion and nuclear (radioactive) decay. Uranium is an element which is unstable and undergoes radioactive decay at a very slow rate. This makes uranium a good choice to use as a fuel in nuclear power stations. Nuclear power stations therefore use uranium and induce nuclear fission to release the heat and radiation. Let's take a look inside a nuclear power plant, such as Koeberg Power Station.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Turn to the front of you workbook and find uranium on the Periodic Table. It has the symbol U and atomic number 92.</p>
</div><figure id="gd-idp6362064"><img src="images/gr9ec06-gd-0019.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The main difference between a nuclear power station and other power stations, such as coal power stations, is the way in which the water is heated to produce the steam.</p>

<p>A nuclear power station has a nuclear reactor vessel. The nuclear power station needs to control the huge amount of energy given off during nuclear fission of uranium in order to generate electrical energy. The nuclear reactor is the device in which the nuclear reactions take place and are controlled. The uranium is formed into pellets which are arranged into long rods, called the reactor core. The rods together make a bundle which is inserted into water to prevent overheating and melting. The bundle of uranium rods also contains control rods which help to control the process.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>The control rods can also be used to shutdown the reactor in case of an accident or to change the uranium fuel.</p>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>In March 2011, thousands of Japanese citizens evacuated the area surrounding the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant after a powerful earthquake and resulting tsunami seriously damaged the power station. The water leaked out of the reactor, resulting in overheating and a partial nuclear meltdown.</p>
</div>
<p>The large amounts of energy produced by the nuclear fission reactions in the uranium fuel rods heat the water to produce steam. The steam is used to turn large turbines which transfer the kinetic energy to generators, which produce electricity in the same way as in other power stations.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Both nuclear fusion and nuclear fission show promise to be used in space to propel spacecraft. Nuclear fission is also used in submarines to propel them forward. This is called nuclear marine propulsion.</p>

</div>
<p>Most of South Africa's power stations use the burning of coal to produce enough heat to boil the water. The only difference in a nuclear power station is how the energy is produced to heat the water and produce steam.</p>

<p>As was mentioned before, the nuclear fuel is radioactive. The radiation that the fuel emits is dangerous and can be very harmful as it can enter our bodies and damage our cells. The workers in nuclear power plants therefore need to take extra precautions. The nuclear reactor is also contained within a special container that acts as a barrier to radiation.</p>

<p>You might have heard some of the debate surrounding the use of nuclear fuel in power stations. There are many supporters but also many critics. Let's look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of using nuclear fuel.</p>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power</h1>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Discuss and answer the questions that follow.</li>
<li>You will then be divided into groups to do some extra reading and research and host a debate for and against the advancement and development of nuclear power in South Africa.</li>
</ol><p>What are some of the advantages of nuclear fuel? Discuss this with your partner and write down your answers below.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The biggest advantage is that nuclear power does not depend on fossil fuels. Fossil fuel power stations release huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which contribute to the greenhouse effect and climate change. It is therefore also not affected by the constantly changing oil and gas price. The use of nuclear fuel is also very efficient as huge amounts of electricity are generated using only a small amount of fuel. This is due to the extremely large amounts of energy released during nuclear fission. We are not about to run out of nuclear fuel.</p>

<p/>
</div><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Nuclear fission produces roughly a million times more energy per unit mass than fossil fuel alternatives.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the major disadvantages is that once the nuclear fuel has been used, it cannot just be thrown away in a city dump. The spent nuclear fuel is high-level radioactive waste. The radiation can also damage animals and plants. This nuclear waste needs to be disposed of carefully and correctly so that the radiation is not able to cause a lot of damage. Over time, the nuclear waste will decay to safe levels of radioactivity, but this takes thousands of years. In the meantime, it has to be stored so that it does not cause any damage or fall into the hands of nuclear arms manufacturers. This adds to the cost of using nuclear fuels. Some people also have reservations about nuclear power plants as the potential for a nuclear reactor meltdown are catastrophic.</p>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>In 1986, the Ukrainian nuclear reactor in Chernobyl exploded and released 50 tonnes of radioactive material into the area, destroying forests and causing 30 000 people to evacuate the area. Thousands of people subsequently died from cancer and other illnesses.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>The debate over whether or not nuclear energy is the answer to a growing international energy crisis is very relevant. This is an opportunity for the learners to do some research into the pros and cons of increasing the world's reliance on nuclear energy. It would be a good idea to encourage the learners to find reputable sources of information. They should look at articles and research written by scientists and those with real expertise and knowledge rather than lay people. Arrange the class into two groups; those for the use of nuclear energy and those against the use of nuclear energy. Allow each group to research evidence to support their stance and then let them debate as a class. There is no correct conclusion to the debate. It would be interesting to see if the research and debate causes some of them to change their stance, whether they are for or against. A suggestion is to watch the TED talk on nuclear energy.</p>

<p>We are now going to look at what happens to the electricity that is generated in a power station, whether it is coal, nuclear or a hydroelectric power plant.</p></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-3">National electricity grid</h2><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>national electricity grid</li>

<li>transmission lines</li>
<li>pylon</li>
<li>power surge</li>
</ul></div>
<p>The national energy grid is a network of interacting parts which form one big system to provide electricity to all sectors of the economy. It starts at the power stations where the electricity is generated. The power stations then feed the electric current into large power lines called transmission lines. There is a massive network of transmission lines that extends throughout the entire country. The transmission lines are supported by pylons.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ec06-gd-0021.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">The national power lines transmit electricity across the country from the power stations.</figcaption></figure><p>The following diagram illustrates a coal-powered power station connected to the national electricity grid.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp3616528"><img src="images/gr9ec06-gd-0022.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Very high currents are generated at the power stations. The transmission lines have some resistance. If the power stations transferred electricity at high currents, what do you think would happen in the transmission lines? Hint: Remember what we learned about the effects of resistance.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p/>

<p>Transferring electricity at very high currents through wires that have resistance would cause the wires to become hot and so a lot of energy would be wasted in the form of heat to the surroundings.</p>

<p/>
</div>
<p>To prevent the waste of energy, the electric current is rather sent through the transmission lines at very high voltages and low current.</p>

<p>However, these voltages are too high for use in both private homes and commercial buildings. In our homes and buildings we need a low voltage and high current again.</p>

<p>Transformers are used to change the voltages at different points in the grid. As you can see in the previous diagram, the electricity first goes through a transformer before entering the national transmission lines. This is a step-up transformer as it increases the voltage and lowers the current. When the electricity reaches the substation to be distributed locally, there is a step-down transformer which decreases the voltage again and increases the current.</p>

<p>All the systems in the national electricity grid are connected and this means that a power surge or a grid overload can cause blackouts and disruptions throughout the network. What is a power surge?</p>

<p>A power surge is a sudden increase in the voltage somewhere in an electric circuit. The power surge causes an increase in the current strength. This sudden increase in the current strength can damage sensitive circuits.</p>

<p>Lightning strikes near a transmission line can cause a power surge. Other causes of power surges or a grid overload include faulty wiring, or appliances or equipment that require a lot of energy when they are switched on and off. These sudden demands or excesses of energy cause brief changes in voltage that can cause a surge. There are several points in the national grid which can detect a power surge or grid overload. If these are detected then the power supply to that area is cut off.</p>

<p>Why can we consider the national electricity grid as a system? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The national grid is a system as it is made of different parts working together to deliver electricity. A change in one part of the grid will affect other parts.</p>

        
<p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>We can divide the national electricity grid up into 4 main stages. These are:</p>

        
<p><strong>A: Generation</strong> (this is where electricity is generated)</p>

        
<p><strong>B: Transmission</strong> (the electricity enters the power lines of the national grids and is transmitted)</p>

        
<p><strong>C: Distribution</strong> (the electricity is distributed from substations to various towns and areas)</p>

        
<p><strong>D: Consumers</strong> (this is where the electricity is transferred to useful energy outputs)</p>

        
<p>Use this information to write the letters A, B, C and D on the diagram of the national electricity grid to label these stages. [4 marks]</p>

<p>Why is electricity transmitted through the power lines at high voltages and low current strength? [3 marks]</p>

         
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p>There is resistance in the transmission lines. If the current is very high then a lot of energy is lost to the lines in the form of heat. It is expensive to produce electricity and we don&#8217;t want to waste any. If the current is low then less energy is wasted in the lines.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Most household appliances need a voltage of 220 - 240 V. If the electricity in the transmission lines is very high then how are we able to use it? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>Transformers are used to change the voltage from high to a low voltage so that the appliances in our homes are not damaged.</p>

<p>Why should you protect your computer from power surges? [2 marks]</p>

        
<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>

        
<p>The sensitive circuits in a computer require small currents. A power surge puts a large current into the circuit. This can damage the wiring in the circuit and stop it from working.</p>
