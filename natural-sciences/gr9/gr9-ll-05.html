<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1.5 weeks</p>

<p>Learners have already been introduced to the digestive system in Chapter 2. This chapter focuses more on a healthy diet and the different components making up a healthy diet. Learners will be required to conduct some food tests to investigate which foods contain which components, such as starch and fats. The chapter will also look at the alimentary canal and digestion in more detail to see how the food we eat becomes a form which can be absorbed into our bodies. In Gr 6 CAPS, learners do an introduction to nutrition and learn about the basic food groups.</p>

<p/>

<p>In this chapter we are going to look more closely at the food we eat to see why certain foods are considered healthy and others unhealthy. We will then investigate how the food from our plates gets to our cells and why our digestive system is so well adapted for its job.</p>

<p>Our human bodies are very active. Our bodies need a huge variety of different nutrients and substances in order to perform all these processes. We obtain these nutrients from the food we eat. The human body needs a balanced, healthy diet to keep functioning property.</p>

</div>
<p/>

<p>Let's take a closer look at what makes up a healthy diet.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">The seven building blocks of a healthy diet</h3><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>protein</li>
<li>carbohydrates</li>
<li>fats</li>
<li>fibre</li>
<li>glucose</li>
<li>vitamins</li>
<li>minerals</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>The foods that we eat can be divided into different groups:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>proteins</li>
<li>carbohydrates</li>
<li>fats and oils</li>
<li>vitamins</li>
<li>minerals</li>
<li>fibre (non-digestible carbohydrates)</li>
<li>water</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>A healthy diet consists of foods from all of these groups.</p>
<div class="section"><h4 class="title">Proteins</h4>
<p>Proteins are our bodies' building blocks. They build and repair body cells and tissues. Foods rich in protein are: fish, meat, poultry, eggs, cheese and other food from animal sources. There are also many sources of protein from plants. For example: products made from soya beans, peas and beans, nuts and seeds.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0001.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Meat.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0002.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Eggs.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0003.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Almond nuts.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0004.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Cheese.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Carbohydrates</h4>
<p>Carbohydrates are the main supply of energy for our bodies. They break down in our digestive system to form glucose (which is a sugar). Examples of foods that contain carbohydrates are: whole grain bread, potatoes, pasta, rice, fruit, vegetables, maize and legumes.</p>

<p/>

<p>Unfortunately many people eat too many carbohydrates, especially processed carbohydrates like sweets and biscuits, chips, pastries, soft drinks and sweetened fruit juices.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Often, fruit juice is not the healthiest choice of drink as some fruit juices contain the same amount or more sugar than the average soft drink. The best choice is water!</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Fats and oils are important for many body processes:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Fat protects and insulates your organs</li>
<li>They help maintaining healthy hair and nails.</li>
<li>Some vitamins can only be absorbed and transported when attached to fat molecules.</li>
<li>Fats and oils also provide the body with energy.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>However, some fats are better than others and having too much of any type is not a good idea.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0009.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Olive oil and canola oil are both healthy oils.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0010.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Sardines are high in healthy fats.</figcaption></figure><p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Vitamins</h4><figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0011.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Our sources of vitamins are from fruit...</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0012.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">...and vegetables.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Vitamins help with the different chemical reactions in our bodies:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li><strong>vitamin A</strong> helps strengthen our immune system and is good for eyesight in the dark</li>
<li><strong>B vitamins</strong> help us process energy from food</li>
<li><strong>vitamin C</strong> helps to keep your skin and gums healthy and improves the immune system</li>
<li><strong>vitamin D</strong> helps to build strong bones and teeth</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Our main sources of vitamins are from fruit and vegetables. The following diagram summarises some of these sources for various vitamins. You do not need to know all of these.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Many people take large amounts of supplements to ensure they get enough vitamins and minerals. However it is rather wasteful as the body excretes any excess vitamins and minerals and only stores a few vitamins like Vitamin A, D, E and K.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0013.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Food sources of different vitamins.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Minerals</h4>
<p>Our bodies cannot produce minerals and we therefore need to include these in our diets. Some of the minerals we should include in our diets are:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li><strong>calcium</strong> which is essential for strong bones and teeth.</li>
<li><strong>iron</strong> which is needed for healthy blood.</li>
<li><strong>magnesium</strong> which is used for building strong bones, teeth and muscles.</li>
<li><strong>sodium</strong> which is also needed for muscle and nerve function, and more importantly it helps regulate the amount of water in the blood.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>There are a variety of sources of minerals. For example, high levels of calcium are found in dairy products, meat is a high source of iron, and magnesium is found in lots of foods such as bananas, nuts, green leafy vegetables and milk. The most common source of sodium is in sodium chloride, which is table salt.</p></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Fibre</h4>
<p>Fibre found in the skins of fruit and vegetables, and in wholegrain cereals, cannot be digested. It therefore travels through the alimentary canal. We need fibre in our diet as it helps us to have regular bowel movements and avoid constipation. .</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0014.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Beans are a good source of fibre.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0015.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trekkyandy/3316748814/"/><figcaption class="caption">High fibre breakfast cereal. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trekkyandy/3316748814/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/trekkyandy/3316748814/ </a></figcaption></figure></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Water</h4>
<p>Our bodies are made up of more than 50 percent water. Water is necessary to help our blood carry nutrients and waste around the body and to help the chemical reactions that occur in our cells. Water forms most of sweat, saliva and tears.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9ll05-gd-0016.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">You need to drink water daily.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p/><p>The fruit salad is healthier as it contains a variety of fresh fruits which are high in fibre and packed with healthy vitamins. Fruit salad will satisfy some of your requirement of fruit and vegetables for the day. The fruit loops are unhealthy as they contain a lot of sugars and artificial colourants and flavourants. They have limited nutritional value in terms of vitamins and minerals.</p>

<p/><p>The omelette is the healthier option. As with the egg salad, this meal contains fresh salad and the eggs are a source of protein.

<p>Different cultures and religions follow different diets. Some cultures will only eat certain types of food and will avoid other combinations. Some religions might restrict their followers to only certain foods while others have no real dietary laws. Within South Africa, we have a very diverse population with people from many cultures, backgrounds and religions. This makes our country a truly unique, diverse and interesting place in which to live!</p></div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Testing food</h3><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>emulsion</li>

<p/>

<p>There are various chemical tests which are used to easily identify the type of food molecules present in different foods.</p>

<p/>

<p>Once such test is the <strong>starch test</strong>. We can also test for the presences of fats and oils using the <strong>emulsion test</strong>.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>In lower grades you might recall doing the starch test on plants to see which leaves store starch from the glucose produced in photosynthesis.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">Which foods contain starch and fats and oils?</h1>
<p>In this investigation, learners will be provided with the background information and basic instructions. They will have to design the investigation themselves and then write up their findings in an experimental report.</p>

<p>Before the lesson starts, set up each workbench with the materials and apparatus the learners will require to do the food tests.</p>

<p><strong>The materials required are (per learner or group):</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>various food items to test for starch: for example, pieces of bread, apple, tomato, boiled egg, cheese, cucumber, potato, yoghurt, ham (some substances must contain starch and some not)</li>
<li>various food items to test for fats and oil: for example, the above food items can be used, and in addition, you could also provide peanut butter and butter</li>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>You need to conduct an investigation to test whether the food substances you have been provided with contain starch or fats and oils or both.</li>
<li>A summary of each test is given below. You will need to design your investigation and conduct it.</li>
<li>Before starting, think about how you will record your results and write out your proposed method.</li>
</ol><p/>

<p><strong>Starch iodine test:</strong></p>

<p>Iodine solution is an orange-brown colour. When iodine is added to a substance which has starch in it, the iodine reacts with the starch to produce a blue-black colour. The blue-black colour indicates the presence of starch.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners will need to use the dropper to add a couple drops of the iodine solution to the food substance to be tested in a petri dish. Let them practise on a small piece of white paper, so they see the colour change before trying it on the food. Starch hold the fibres in paper together.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>Fat emulsion test:</strong></p>

<p>To conduct the test, crush a piece of the food (or liquid) in a small amount of ethanol. Pour some of the mixture onto paper. Once the ethanol has evaporated, oil stains on the paper will indicate the presence of fats or oils in the food.</p>

<p/>

<p>Digestion involves a variety of complex processes that turn the food that you eat into tiny molecules that can then be absorbed and transported to the cells of the body.</p>

<p/>

<p>There are two types of digestion:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li><strong>Mechanical digestion</strong> occurs when food is physically broken down through chewing, churning and mashing. Mechanical digestion takes place in your mouth and in your stomach.</li>
</ol><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Mechanical digestion does not change the chemical properties of the food. Rather, it changes the physical properties by breaking large pieces up into small pieces, therefore it can also be called physical digestion.</p>
</div><ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li><strong>Chemical digestion</strong> takes place when different digestive <strong>enzyme s</strong>break down the bits of food into smaller molecules. Enzymes are special proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions in the body. Chemical digestion starts in the mouth where enzymes in your saliva start to break down starch. Chemical digestion also takes place in the stomach and small intestine.</li>

<p>We already studied the alimentary canal in Chapter 2 so we'll start by reviewing what we learnt there.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Dr William Beaumont (1785 - 1853) discovered how food is digested in the stomach. He dropped food, attached to silk threads, into the stomach of a patient who had a gunshot wound to the stomach that would not close, and examined what happened.</p>

<p>Learners must draw straight, parallel label lines with a ruler and labels should be written one underneath the other. In this image, the liver is the large red organ next to the stomach, and the gallbladder is the small green part in front of it. The liver produces bile which it then secretes into the gallbladder to be stored before it enters the digestive tract. Bile helps with fat digestion. The pancreas, the yellow organ below the stomach in the diagram, is another organ which plays an important role in digestion as it produces the enzymes for chemical digestion which are secreted into the small intestine. The liver, pancreas and gallbladder are accessory organs to the digestive system. However, they are not part of the alimentary canal. Make learners aware that there is a difference in discussing the digestive system (including these accessory organs) and the alimentary canal (which only focuses on the organs and structures through which food passes and not the 
liver, pancreas and gallbladder).</p>

<p>Learning how to link the structural adaptations of an organ, tissue or cell to its function is a very important skill to start developing.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Let us make a model of the alimentary canal that can demonstrate mechanical and chemical digestion in the different parts, and also learn about how the different parts are structurally adapted to suit their function.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Although CAPS states that no detail of how the different parts of the alimentary canal are structurally adapted to suit their function, some of this information has been included in the following activity. It was felt that it is necessary to start developing this skill as learners will often have to describe structural adaptations for function in Life Sciences Gr. 10-12. This skill is often poorly developed in learners and so it is beneficial to start introducing learner to this kind of reasoning and explanations of biological structures from early on. This is an <strong><u>optional activity</u></strong>.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">A digestion simulation</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Objectives for this activity:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Learn about how the different parts are structurally adapted to their function.</li>
<li>Describe the parts of the alimentary canal and what each part's functions are.</li>
<li>Understand physical and chemical digestion.</li>
<li>Discuss how food travels from ingestion to digestion to absorption and egestion.</li>
<li>Make observations regarding the process of digestion.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>A suggestion is to make learners work in groups and produce one model per group. This way they will be able to discuss the model with each other as they are going along and there might also be less mess. Set up a workstation for each group prior to the lesson with the required materials laid out. The materials below are suggestions to be used to create a model of each part. However, you can also use other materials if you have more appropriate ideas or access to other materials in your classroom.</p>

<p/>

<p>Alternatively, you could also do this activity as a demonstration in the front of the class, discussing the model and structures as you go along.</p>

<p/>

<p>If you are not able to physically produce the model of digestion with your learners in class, you can still read through the activity and learners can still answer the questions and you can discuss the structural adaptations.</p>

Learners should note the downfall of this part of the model as food does not 'roll' down the oesophagus as they have done here in the simulation. Rather, the food is moved down by the peristaltic actions of the muscles surrounding the oesophagus. Learners should think up alternative ways to simulate or represent this action, such as using a plastic tube which is not hard and using your hands to squeeze the food down the tube and out the other side into the bag.</p>

<p>You may want to explain how peristalsis works by showing how the muscles around the small intestine squeeze rhythmically to push the food from the stomach through the entire intestine. Let learners use their hands to simulate peristalsis - if one hand is squeezing tightly around the small intestine the other releases and relaxes around the small intestine.</p>

<p/><p>The food is mixing with the bicarbonate of soda dissolved in water and moving through the small intestine. The food takes a very long time to move through the small intestine and the liquid is running through the stockings and into the large dish or onto the table.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Compare the model to the actual process in your small intestine. </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>When food arrives in the small intestine digestive enzymes are secreted from the pancreas and bile from the gallbladder. This is represented by the bicarbonate of soda mixture which is squirted into the stocking. These enzymes digest the food particles that are then able to be absorbed by the cells in the walls of the small intestine. The molecules move into the capillaries and blood stream that surrounds the small intestine. As learners squeeze the food along, some of the liquid runs out of the stocking and this represents the molecules being absorbed into the bloodstream. Learners could also compare the length of the small intestine to the long stocking being used. At the end of the process the food that is left is dryer and can move out of the small intestine as undigested waste that gets egested. In the same way the food that is left in the stocking is moved to the open end of the stocking and released.</p>

<table class="white"><tr><td><p>The large intestine absorbs water and mineral salts, to make some vitamins, and to decay the undigested food materials to form faeces. The large intestine is specifically adapted for its function as follows:</p>

                    <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Undigested waste remains in the large intestine for up to 24 hours in order to maximise the absorption of water from this region.</li>
<li>The muscles in the large intestine are able to turn the waste material into faeces preparing it for egestion.</li>
<li>When it is time to egest waste, the muscles in the large intestine create strong peristaltic movements to force the faeces out of the body via the rectum and anus.</li>
<li>Circular muscles in the anus control the emptying of the waste materials.</li>

<p>In exams and tests you will be asked how a specific structure is adapted to its function. Remember when you see such a question to break it down into four separate steps:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li><strong>Outline</strong>: Give a brief explanation of the the main point you will discuss, i.e. structure, function and specific adaption(s).</li>
<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Here you need to specify what the structure looks like.</li>
<li><strong>Function</strong>: What does it need to do? What role does it play or purpose does it fulfil?</li>
<li><strong>Adaptation</strong>: This is where you put together structure and function - it has X, so it can do Y. For example, it is thin, so gases diffuse through it quickly.</li>

<p/>

<p>The alimentary canal is made of several parts linked together - two of these parts are missing in the concept map. We also looked at two types of digestion in this chapter. What are these? When filling them in on the concept map, you need to decide which space to put them in by looking at the concepts which come after to describe each type.</p>

<p>Which of the foods in Question 2 contain starch? How can you test if they contain starch? [9 marks] </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>The starch test will indicate whether a food contains starch - if you drop iodine solution on the food and the iodine turns from brownish-orange to blue-black then the food contains starch. Food that will possibly test positive for starch in the above examples are: green beans, split peas and lentils, butternut, digestive biscuits, fried chips.</p>

<p>Give at least 2 reasons why we should eat raw fruit and vegetables. [2 marks] </p><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Heat can break down some vitamins and boiling dissolves them and minerals out of the food, so it's better to eat them raw.</p>

<p>Some food may take up to 24 to 36 hours to digest and be fully absorbed. Why do you think this process takes so long and why is this a good thing? [2 marks] </p><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Food that is digested over a long period of time has all the beneficial nutrients removed from it rather than travelling through the digestive system really fast and having only a part of the nutritional value of the food absorbed from it.</p>
