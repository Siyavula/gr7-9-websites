<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>This chapter builds on the introduction to chemical equations given in Chapter 1 and 3 of Gr. 8 Matter and Materials.</p>

<p/>

<p>By this stage, learners should know that atoms are rearranged during a chemical reaction. The atoms do not change; only their arrangement in relation to each other changes.</p>

<p/>

<p>Learners were introduced to particle diagrams in Gr. 8 and this skill will be further reinforced in this chapter. We have tried to introduce learners to the idea that chemical reactions can be thought of in different ways. Ultimately, they have to be able to write chemical equations, but this is a very complex skill. By starting with word equations and progressing to submicroscopic representations (picture equations) before translating the latter to the symbolic format (chemical equations), we hope to build/scaffold the learning of chemical equations as well as develop learners' ability to imagine events on the submicroscopic scale.</p>

<div class="note col-md-10" data-type="keyquestions"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>What is a chemical reaction?</li>
<li>How can we represent what happens in a chemical reaction?</li>
<li>What do the different symbols in a chemical reaction equation mean?</li>
<li>What do the numbers in a chemical reaction mean?</li>

</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>In Gr. 8 Matter and Materials we learnt about <strong>chemical reactions</strong> for the first time. Can you remember the main ideas about chemical reactions? Here they are again:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>During chemical reactions, materials are changed into new materials with new chemical and physical properties.</li>
<li>
<p>The materials we start with are called <strong>reactants</strong>, and the new materials that form are called <strong>products</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>During a chemical reaction, atoms are rearranged. This requires that bonds are broken in the reactants and new bonds are formed in the products.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>In this chapter we are going to build on these ideas. We will focus on two things:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>how to write chemical reaction equations; and</li>
<li>how to balance chemical reaction equations.</li>
</ol><p/>

<p>This will prepare us for the chapters that follow this one, in which we will be looking at different types of chemical reactions.</p>

<p/>

<p>Before we get to chemical reactions, however, it is important that we remind ourselves of the different ways that we have been thinking about chemical compounds up to now. The next section will show how they all fit together.</p>

<p/>
<div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-1">Thinking about chemical reactions</h2><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>bond</li>
<li>reactant</li>
<li>product</li>
<li>chemical reaction</li>
<li>macroscopic</li>
<li>submicroscopic</li>
<li>symbolic</li>
</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>Scientists learn to think about compounds on three different levels:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>macroscopic</li>
<li>microscopic</li>
<li>submicroscopic</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>As a young scientist, you have already been introduced to this kind of thinking. The three levels can also be thought of as three different ways to represent compounds. The next activity will help you understand what this means.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Drawing water</h1>
<p/>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS:</strong></p>

<p>The instruction for this activity is really simple: Draw a picture of water. You may use the space below for your drawing.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Do not give any further instructions, but allow the learners to interpret the question in any way they want to. Ask the learners to show their work. Some may draw a landscape with water (a dam or river) and others may draw a glass or similar container with clear colourless liquid inside it. Perhaps one or two will draw a water molecule or the chemical formula for water. Get some of the learners to redraw their pictures on the board.</p>
</div>
<p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p>Your drawing may look like one of the diagrams below. They all represent water. But which one is correct?</p>
<figure id="gd-idm4750672"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0001.png" width="300"/></figure><p>They are all correct!</p>

<p/>

<p>The three diagrams above all represent water, but they are very different from each other. We say that they are three different <strong>representations</strong> of the same thing, namely water.</p>

<p/>
</div>

<p>The following diagram shows how the three representations fit together.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm2233648"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The water molecule in the top right shows what a particle of water would look like (i). We cannot see water particles with our eyes, therefore we have to imagine them. This is why the water molecule is inside a thought bubble. We call this a <strong>submicroscopic representation</strong>.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Submicroscopic means 'smaller than microscopic', or 'too small to see through a microscope'. Sometimes it helps to think that this is what we would see if we had special 'submicroscopic goggles' on to 'see' at the atomic level!</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>Find out about special microscopes which enable people to 'see' atoms<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://myscienceacademy.org/2013/04/03/have-you-ever-seen-an-atom/"> http://myscienceacademy.org/2013/04/03/have-you-ever-seen-an-atom/</a></p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The beaker of water shows what water looks like to our eyes (ii). We call this a <strong>macroscopic representation</strong>, because it is observable. That means it can be observed by using our senses such as seeing, feeling, hearing, tasting or touching.</p>

<p/>

<p>The chemical formula on the left uses chemical symbols to represent water (iii). We have learnt that chemical formulae are made up of element symbols. We can think of chemical symbols and formulae as a chemical 'language', because they tell a story. The 'story' told by the formula H<sub>2</sub>O is that a water molecule consists of two atoms of H and one atom of O. The formula 'H<sub>2</sub>O' is a <strong>symbolic representation</strong>.</p>

<p/>

<p>Experienced scientists can move easily between these three levels. They can translate the symbolic language of chemical formulae to submicroscopic pictures in their mind. This is what we will practice in this chapter.</p>

<p/>

<p>Before moving on, try another example where you draw the 3 different levels of carbon dioxide in the space below. label each level. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners could draw a closed container with a clear gas in it for the macroscopic representation. They should write the formula CO<sub>2</sub> for the symbolic representation.They should draw a carbon dioxide molecule for the submicroscopic representation as follows:</p>

<p>How would you define a chemical reaction? Write down some of your ideas. The following words may help you formulate your sentences.</p>
<table><tr><td><p>reactants, products, bonds, rearranged, atoms, molecules, new compounds</p></td></tr></table><p/><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Get learners to first take some notes and describe what they think a chemical reaction is. You can even just ask them the question and get their definitions.</p>
</div>
<p>A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms in which one or more compounds are changed into new compounds.</p>

<p>All chemical reactions can be represented by equations and models. To some people, chemical equations may seem very hard to understand. Since atoms and molecules can not be seen they have to be imagined and that can be quite difficult! Luckily, we have had some preparation because we have been drawing molecules since Gr. 7.</p>

<p>Anytime that atoms separate from each other and recombine into different combinations of atoms, we say a chemical reaction has occurred. No atoms are lost or gained, they are simply rearranged.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">1. Word equations</h3><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>In mathematic equations we use an equal sign (=) for example 2 + 2 = 4, but in scientific chemical equations, we use an arrow (&#8594;), for example C + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594; CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>
<p>When we represent a chemical reaction in terms of words, we write a <strong>word equation</strong>. For example, when hydrogen gas reacts with oxygen gas to form water, we can write a word equation for the reaction as follows:</p>

<p><strong>hydrogen + oxygen&#8594; water</strong></p>

<p>To the left of the arrow, we have the 'before' situation. This side represents the substances we have beforethe reaction takes place. They are called the <strong>reactants</strong>. What are the reactants of this reaction? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The reactants are hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>To the right of the arrow we have the 'after' situation. This sides represents the substances that we have after the reaction has taken place. They are called the <strong>products</strong>. What is the product of this reaction? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The product is water.</p>
</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-4">2. Picture equations</h3>
<p>The same reaction of hydrogen reacting with oxygen, can also be represented in pictures called submicroscopic diagrams. The diagram below shows that the atoms in two hydrogen molecules (H<sub>2</sub>) and one oxygen molecule (O<sub>2</sub>) on the left rearrange to form the two water molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O) on the right of the arrow. Hydrogen atoms are white circles and oxygen atoms are red circles.</p>

<p/>

<p>What kind of representation is this: macroscopic, submicroscopic, or symbolic? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Submicroscopic, because it shows the particles.</p>
</div><figure id="gd-idm1503792"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0004.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Now we are going to convert our submicroscopic picture to a symbolicone:</p>

<p>What is the product of the above reaction? What are the reactants of the above reaction? Write their formulae.  </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The product is H<sub>2</sub>O. The reactants are H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">3. Chemical equations</h3>
<p>When we represent a chemical reaction in terms of chemical formulae (symbols), it is called a <strong>chemical equation</strong>. The chemical equation for the above reaction would be as follows:</p>

<p><strong>2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594;2 H<sub>2</sub>O</strong></p>

<p>What kind of representation is this: macroscopic, submicroscopic, or symbolic?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Symbolic, because it uses formulae (symbols).</p>

<p>We still have reactants on the left and products on the right.</p>

<p>When you look at the reaction equation above you will notice two kinds of numbers:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>Numbers <em>in front of</em> chemical formulae in the equation. They are called <strong>coefficients</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smaller numbers used <em>inside and below</em> the chemical formulae. These are called <strong>subscripts</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Coefficients and subscripts mean different things, as you will see in the next section.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-6">Coefficients and subscripts in chemical equations</h3>
<p>Why is there a '2' in front of the formula for water (H<sub>2</sub>O) in the chemical equation for water? This is because two molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O can be made from two molecules of H<sub>2</sub> and one molecule of O<sub>2</sub> in our reaction.</p>

<p>The numbers in front of the formulae in the chemical equation are called <strong>coefficients</strong>. They represent the numbers of individual molecules that are in the chemical reaction.</p>

<p>You will notice that O<sub>2</sub> does not have a coefficient in the reaction above. When there is no coefficient, it means that just one molecule of that substance takes part in the reaction.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter, we learnt how to interpret chemical formulae. When we read the formula, the <strong>subscripts</strong> tell us how many atoms of a particular element are in one molecule of that compound.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm4869392"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0009.png" width="300"/></figure></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-7">Balanced equations</h2><div class="note col-md-6" data-type="newwords"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>balanced</li>

<p>Now we are going to learn what it means when a reaction is <strong>balanced</strong>. Here is our submicroscopic picture again.</p>

<p/>

<p>Did you notice that the numbers and types of atoms are the same on the left and on the right of the reaction? The reactants have four H atoms and two O atoms. The products have four H atoms and two O atoms.</p>

<p/>

<p>When this is true of a reaction equation, we say the equation is <strong>balanced</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that we know how to recognise a balanced equation, we are going to learn how to balance them!</p>

<p/>

<p>What is a balanced equation? Write down your own definition. </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Either get learners to write down their own definitions and then read them out to the class, or they can just volunteer answers. You can get learners to start with: We say an equation is balanced when... A potential answer is: "We say a reaction is balanced when the total numbers and types of atoms in the reactants are equal to those in the products".</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We are going to use a few examples of real reactions to learn how to balance equations. In the chapters following this one, we are going to see what these reactions look like in real life, but for now, we will just focus on how to balance equations.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Magnesium burning in oxygen</h1>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Magnesium flakes are often used in some fireworks, such as sparklers, because when they burn they create the bright, shimmering sparks.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>When magnesium metal burns in oxygen, we can write the following word equation for the reaction that occurs between these two elements:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>magnesium + oxygen&#8594; magnesium oxide</strong></p>

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What is your conclusion: Is the equation balanced? Explain your answer. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>No, the equation is not balanced because the numbers of the atoms are not the same in the reactants and products.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p/>
</div>

<p/>

<p>So how could we balance the equation to describe magnesium burning in oxygen? When balancing reactions, there is one simple rule:</p>

<p/>

<p>You may only add compounds that are already in the equation. This means only coefficients may be changed, not subscripts!</p>

<p/>

<p>Let's try a few alternative solutions. Would it help to add an O atom on the right, like this?</p>
<figure id="gd-idm5326992"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0014.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Now the O atoms are balanced on both sides of the equation, but we don't have MgO on the right anymore. We have changed the formula on the right to MgO<sub>2</sub>. That means we have changed a subscript in the formula. You cannot change the formula of a compound when balancing chemical equations.</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Ask learners why it is not allowed. Is MgO the same as MgO<sub>2</sub>? Remind them of the earlier example of H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which were not the same compound. MgO and MgO<sub>2</sub> can not be the same compound because they do not have the same chemical formula. The ratio of Mg and O atoms are different in the two compounds. (The compound MgO<sub>2</sub> does not even exist, but you do not have to go into this.)</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Adding single atoms to any side of the equation is also not allowed. That means the following equation is also not correct:</p>
<figure id="gd-idp5042384"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0015.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>Remember that we may only use the chemical formulae that are already in the equation. We need two MgO's on the right to balance the two O's in O<sub>2</sub>. We also need two Mg's on the left to balance the two MgO's on the right.</p>
<figure id="gd-idm4453744"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0016.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>Can you build this equation with play dough balls or beads? When you convert the play dough 'reactants' to 'products', are there any unused 'atoms' left behind afterwards? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>No, there are not. Get learners to actually do this activity and practice making the equation using balanced numbers of atoms.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Now, let us take this a step further. We are going to convert our balanced submicroscopic equation to a symbolic chemical equation. Write down a balanced equation for magnesium burning in oxygen to produce magnesium oxide. </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Write this up on the board and explain again how the equation is balanced:</p>

<p>2 Mg + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594; 2 MgO</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Here are a few important rules for balancing chemical equations:</p>

<p/>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>When we balance reaction equations we may ONLY add coefficients to the chemical formulae that are already in the equation.</li>
<li>We may NOT change the chemical formulae of any of the reactants or products by changing the subscripts in a formula.</li>
<li>We may NOT add other reactants or products. This includes adding single atoms of any of the elements already in the reaction equation.</li>
<li>We may NOT remove reactants or products.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>We are now ready to practice balancing other reaction equations.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Iron reacts with oxygen</h1>
<p/>

<p>When iron rusts, it is because the iron metal reacts with oxygen in the air to form iron oxide.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0017.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dok1/3513263469/"/><figcaption class="caption">An old car with rust on the bonnet. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dok1/3513263469/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/dok1/3513263469/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>The word equation is the following:</p>

<p><strong>iron + oxygen&#8594; iron oxide</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>The chemical equation is the following:</p>

<p><strong>Fe + O<sub>2</sub>&#8594;Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></strong></p>

<p/>

<p>Is the equation balanced? Draw a submicroscopic picture to help you decide. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learner's diagram should look like this. They may find it difficult to convert the equations into diagrams. Help them to interpret the formulae in the following way: Fe on its own means there is just one atom of iron (Fe). O<sub>2</sub> means there must be two atoms of O, linked up to form a molecule. Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> means two Fe atoms and three O atoms are clustered together.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp146016"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0019.png" width="300"/></figure><p>The colours are not important, as long as all the atoms of the same element are the same colour. The arrangement of the atoms in the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 'cluster' is also not important. Since Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is an ionic compound, we would not ordinarily speak of a 'molecule' of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Like all other ionic compounds, it consists of large clusters of Fe3+ and O<sub>2</sub>- ions in a regular crystalline packing that extends in three dimensions, much like the ionic lattice of NaCl in the picture below (shown in Chapter 1 also).</p>
<figure id="gd-idm4005968"><img src="images/gr9mm02-gd-0020.png" width="300"/></figure><p>It is not recommended that you mention this information here, as it more likely to confuse learners at this point than add to their understanding of balancing equations.</p>
</div>

<p>You could also use a table like the one below:</p>

<p/>
<table><tr><td><p><strong>Number of atoms</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Reactants</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Products</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fe</p></td><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr><tr><td><p>O</p></td><td><p/></td><td><p/></td></tr></table><div class="teachers-guide">
