<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>In this chapter learners encounter the reactions of the non-metals, carbon and sulfur [Note: the internationally accepted spelling is now 'sulfur', not 'sulphur',] with oxygen. Once again, the translation between word equation, picture equation and chemical equation is reinforced with exercises and examples.</p>

<p/>

<p>There are no demonstrations prescribed by CAPS for this chapter, but we have included colourful photographs to provide learners with some experience of the splendour of these reactions. Since chemical reactions can seem quite abstract to learners and learning about them in isolation may seem to them as if it lacks relevance, we have also attempted to provide some real-world context to the examples in this chapter.</p>

<p/>

<p>At the end of the chapter a few additional non-metals and their reactions with oxygen have been included as enrichment. You may choose to omit these, but they do highlight an important point, namely that not all non-metals form non-metal dioxides when they react with oxygen. Since both central examples of this chapter result in non-metal dioxides (viz. CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>), one should be mindful of the possible introduction of a misconception in this regard.</p>

</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>Oxygen is all around us in the air we breathe. It is a very <strong>reactive</strong> element. When an element is reactive, it means that it will readily react with many other substances. We saw evidence of the reactive nature of oxygen when we observed how it reacted with iron and magnesium to form metal oxides.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Substances that are not reactive are called unreactive or <strong>inert</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>When a substance reacts with oxygen, we say it <strong>oxidises</strong>. It is called an oxidation reaction. Early chemists used the term oxidation for all reactions in which oxygen was a reactant. The definition of an oxidation reaction is broader and includes other reactions which you will learn about in Gr. 10 if you continue with Physical Sciences.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>In this chapter we look at a few reactions of non-metals with oxygen. Where do we find non-metals on the Periodic Table? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>On the right.</p>

</ul></div>
<p/>

<p>When a non-metal burns in oxygen, a <strong>non-metal oxide</strong> forms as product. Here is the word equation for the general reaction:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>non-metal + oxygen &#8594; non-metal oxide</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>Can you see that it looks similar to the word equation for the reaction between a metal and oxygen? The only difference is that the word 'metal' has been replaced with 'non-metal' on both sides of the equation. Non-metal oxides have different chemical properties to metal oxides. We will learn more about this later on in the term.</p>

<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>An important chemical difference between metal and non-metal oxides is that when metal oxides dissolve in water, they form basic solutions and when non-metal oxides dissolve in water, they form acidic solution.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Let's look at a few specific examples of reactions in which non-metals react with oxygen. The first one is one that you are already familiar with, namely the reaction of carbon and oxygen.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen coal burning in air?</p>

<p>Coal is a form of carbon that is used as <strong>fuel</strong> for many different purposes. It is one of the primary <strong>fossil fuels</strong> that humans use to <strong>generate</strong> electricity for powering our industries, our activities and our living spaces. We will look at this in more detail next term in Energy and Change.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>37% of the electricity generated worldwide is produced from coal.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners should have encountered the topics coal, fossil fuels, renewable and non-renewable energy sources and electricity generation in previous grades (specifically in Gr 6 and 7 Energy and Change) and they will also look at it again next term.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Coal burning in air</h1>
<p/>

<p>The energy in coal comes from the energy stored in plants and other organisms that lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Over the millennia, layers of dead plants and other biological waste were covered by layers of water and soil. The heat and pressure from the top layers caused the plant remains to turn into energy-rich coal.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp7606176"><img src="images/gr9mm04-gd-0003.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>The energy released by burning coal is used to generate electrical energy in coal-powered power stations.</p>

<p/>

<p>Coal is a form of carbon and when it burns in oxygen we can represent the reaction with the following word equation:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>carbon + oxygen &#8594; carbon dioxide</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>Draw a picture equation for this reaction in the space below. <br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>In the picture equation here, the black atoms are carbon (C) and the red atoms are oxygen (O). If learners do not have coloured pens or pencils, they can use patterns and shading to differentiate between different atoms.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp19300560"><img src="images/gr9mm04-gd-0004.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Convert the picture equation into a chemical equation. Is it balanced? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The chemical equation is C + O<sub>2</sub> &#8594; CO<sub>2</sub>. This equation is already balanced.</p>

<p>What group is carbon in on the Periodic Table? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Group 14.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The other elements in the same group as carbon will react in the same way as carbon with oxygen.</p>

<p/>

<p>Since coal is a <strong>non-renewable</strong> energy source as well as one that causes pollution and other environmental problems, scientists and engineers continue to look for alternative fuels and energy sources to eventually replace coal as an energy source. Can you think of the names of some <strong>alternative</strong>, <strong>renewable</strong> energy sources? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Wind energy, solar energy, biofuels, nuclear energy (the latter is not strictly renewable). This content is not included in CAPS (as part of the Grade 9 Matter and Materials requirements). The question has been included in an attempt to create some relevance. The topic of chemical reactions is an abstract one and it often helps to provide some real-world applications to link it to other, less abstract including learners' own experience. This will also link to what learners will cover next term in Energy and Change.</p>

<p>In the next section, we are going to look at the formation of another, less well-known, non-metal oxide named sulfur dioxide. Which non-metal do you think reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide? See if you can write down the formula for sulfur dioxide before we carry on. Here is a hint: What does the <em>di-</em> in <em>di</em>oxide mean? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The non-metal is Sulfur (S). To write the formula, you may need to guide learners to realise there are 2 oxygen atoms in one molecule of sulfur <em><u>di</u></em>oxide: SO<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>Sulfur burns in oxygen to form sulfur dioxide. Your teacher will not demonstrate this reaction, because the sulfur dioxide that forms is a poisonous gas that you and your classmates should not be exposed to.</p>

<p>Sulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a <strong>preservative</strong> for dried fruits, such as dried peaches and apricots and the guava rolls that so many of us love to eat. The fact that it is <strong>toxic</strong> means that very small quantities of it can be added to food to preserve it. In very small quantities SO<sub>2</sub> does not permanently harm a large organism such as a human being, but bacteria cannot survive when it is present. Sulfur dioxide is also an important preservative in many South African wines.</p>

<p>The picture equation for the reaction is shown below. Colours are not important as long as all atoms of the same element have the same colour. In our example, the sulfur atoms are yellow and the oxygen atoms are red. Chemists have evidence that the actual shape of the SO<sub>2</sub> molecule is not linear; in other words, the atoms do not all lie in a straight line as they do in CO<sub>2</sub>. Rather, the SO<sub>2</sub> molecule is believed to have a bent shape, as it appears in the picture equation. Since the explanation for this shape requires some understanding of bonding models, which are beyond the scope of this level of the curriculum, we recommend that you do not 'go there', but accept 'linear' drawings of the SO<sub>2</sub> molecule as correct.</p>

<p>We have looked at two examples of non-metals reacting with oxygen to form non-metal oxides. Both of our examples had a <strong>dioxide</strong> as product (carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide). Do all non-metals form non-metal dioxides when they react with oxygen? What do you think? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Get learners to discuss this for a moment. You may want to ask if water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a non-metal oxide. Point out that hydrogen (H) is a non-metal and that water should be a non-metal oxide. Is it a dioxide? No, because it contains only one oxygen. This is important in highlighting how the non-metals in different groups react differently with oxygen.</p>

<p>Phosphorus is a very <strong>reactive</strong> non-metal. Can you remember what reactive means?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Ask your learners this question to see what they can remember. Compounds that are <em>reactive</em> will readily react with many other substances.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p/>

<p>When phosphorus reacts with oxygen the chemical equation for the reaction is the following:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>4 P + 5 O<sub>2</sub>&gt;&#8594; 2 P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub></strong></p>

<p/>

<p>How many phosphorus atoms are in P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>? How many oxygen atoms are in P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>There are 2 phosphorus and 5 oxygen atoms.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>What is the <strong>systematic name</strong> of the product of this reaction? (If you are unsure how to name it, sneak a peek at the first chapter!) </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Diphosphorus pentoxide</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Can you write a word equation for this reaction? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>phosphorus + oxygen &#8594; diphosphorus pentoxide</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Our final example is a compound that you should be very familiar with!</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-6">The reaction between hydrogen and oxygen</h3>
<p/>

<p>Hydrogen and oxygen also react spectacularly. The reaction between a large quantity of hydrogen and oxygen in the air produces a beautiful orange fireball and a very loud boom! (You can watch the video in the visit box to see this in slow motion.)</p>

<p>Here is a diagram to show what is really happening to the compounds in this reaction. The purpose of the candle shown in the picture is to set the hydrogen gas alight, in other words: to provide enough energy for the reaction to start.</p>

<p>If you choose to demonstrate this in class, take note of the safety precautions. This is a very explosive reaction and everyone present should wear safety goggles.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Can you complete the following chemical equation? The reaction is between hydrogen and oxygen. Write the product where it belongs.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>2 H<sub>2</sub>+ O<sub>2</sub>&#8594;</strong> 
          </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &#8594; 2 H<sub>2</sub>O. You can also get learners to practice rearranging the atoms with this equation, making sure they have a balanced equation.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>What is the common name of the product of this reaction? What is the systematic name of the product of this reaction? (If you are unsure how to name it, sneak a peek at the first chapter!) </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The common name is water and the systematic name is dihydrogen monoxide.</p>
