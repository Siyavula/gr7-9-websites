<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>1 week</p>

<p>In this chapter, learners are introduced to the pH scale and learn how to measure and interpret pH values. There are two activities around pH measurement in this chapter: One is a paper activity and one is an investigation using indicators. There is an introductory activity on measurement - this helps to link this content to what learners might be doing in other subjects, such as Mathematics and Technology, and also to what they already know about measurement.</p>

<p/>

<p>The investigation uses universal indicator paper and red cabbage paper to measure the pH of a selection of household products. If you do not have universal indicator paper, but have universal indicator solution, you could easily adapt the activity in the following way: Instead of using paper, learners should add 2 - 3 drops of universal indicator solution to their test solutions, note and record the resulting colours. Red cabbage solution can also be used instead of paper. It would be best to add approximately 1 ml of each test solution to 2 ml portions of the red cabbage water.</p>

<p/>

<p>To make red cabbage indicator paper, follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Cut a large red cabbage into thin slices and place it in a pot.</li>
<li>Add just enough water to cover the cabbage slices.</li>
<li>Boil it over low heat for approximately 30 minutes, adding water to keep the cabbage covered if necessary.</li>
<li>Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool completely.</li>
<li>Strain the juice off the cabbage slices into a large shallow dish. The boiled cabbage slices can be eaten (or placed in the compost).</li>
<li>Place sheets of absorbent paper (kitchen towel, coffee filters or filter paper) in the cabbage water.</li>
<li>After 30 minutes, remove the paper and leave it in a warm place to dry. You can also dry the paper with a hair dryer, but do not leave it in direct sunlight.</li>
<li>When the paper has completely dried, cut it into strips (approximately 1 cm wide). The strips will keep for a long time if stored in a dry place.</li>
</ol><p/>

<p>The time indicated for this chapter is 1 week and so a suggested 1.5 hours has been allocated to each section. However, as there are only two key tasks in this chapter, you might progress through it at a faster rate than 1 week, and then move onto the next chapter dealing with the reactions of acids with bases, which requires more time.</p>

<p/>

<p>In Grade 7 we learnt about acids and bases. Can you remember how to distinguish between them? Here is a table that highlights the main characteristics of acids and bases.</p>

<p/>
<table><tr><td><p><strong>Acids</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Bases</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Taste sour</p>

<p>Can make bases lose their basic character</p>

<p>Can make acids lose their acidic character</p>

                  
<p>Turn red litmus blue</p></td></tr></table><p>We used the criteria in the table above to classify a number of substances as either acids, bases, or neutral substances. The table below contains some examples and shows their classification.</p>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Indicators</p>
</div>
<p>Indicators can show us if a substance is an acid or a base. In this chapter we are going to link some important new learning to what we already know about acids and bases.</p>

<p>The most important new idea is that we can 'measure' how acidic or basic a substance is.</p>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">A word or two on measurement</h3><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This section briefly creates the link between what learners might have done in other subjects and in previous grades about measurement and scales, especially Mathematics. It is used to show that many things can be measured and is used to introduce the idea of measuring how acidic or basic a substance is, as before this we only ever classified a substance as an acid or a base and did not make reference to a scale.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Let us talk briefly about 'measuring'.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Measuring instruments and units</h1>

<p/>

<p>A measurement always consists of two things: a number and a <strong>unit</strong>. To explain what this means, let's imagine we are measuring the length of a pencil.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp2536656"><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0005.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>What is the length of the pencil in the picture? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>18.5 cm</p>
</div>
<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp8150272"><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0006.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>The unit is a very important part of the measurement because it shows the relative size of the measurement. If you said: "The pencil is 18.5 long", people would not be sure if you meant centimeters, millimeters, or even meters!</p>

<p/>

<p>What unit would you use to measure the length of your classroom? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Meter (m). Centimeter is also acceptable. What learners need to realise is that the unit needs to be made explicit.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>What unit would you use to measure your mass? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>kilogram (kg)</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>What unit would you use to measure temperature? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>degrees Celsius (&#176;C)</p>
</div>
<p/>
</div>

<p/>

<p>Can we 'measure' how acidic or basic a substance is?</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Measuring acidity and basicity</h3>
<p/>

<p>The unit that we use to measure the <strong>acidity</strong> of a substance (how acidic that substance is) is called <strong>pH</strong>. We pronounce the two letters, 'p' and 'H' separately when we say pH.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>The term "pH" was first described by Danish biochemist S&#248;ren Peter Lauritz S&#248;rensen in 1909. The definite origin is disputed, but it is widely accepted that pH is an abbreviation for "power of hydrogen" where "p" is short for the German word <em>potenz</em> (meaning power or exponent of) and H is the element symbol for hydrogen.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Have you ever heard the term pH?</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Get learners to discuss this in class for a few minutes. Perhaps they have seen adverts on TV claiming that a certain brand of shampoo or skin soap is 'pH balanced'. Ask them what they think this means.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Perhaps you have heard of a certain shampoo being 'pH balanced', or a skin soap that is 'neutral'. Perhaps you have heard that it is important for the water in a swimming pool to have 'the right pH'?</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0007.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryochijiiwa/4542559854/"/><figcaption class="caption">A kit for testing swimming pool water pH. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryochijiiwa/4542559854/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/ryochijiiwa/4542559854/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>The pH scale ranges between the values of 1 and 14.</p>

<p/>

<p>In science and in everyday life, we measure the acidity of substances in pH <strong>units</strong>. We could say that the 'acidity' of a specific shampoo has a pH of 5.5. pH is the unit of measurement and 5.5 is be the number indicating the relative acidity on the pH scale. It has become acceptable, however, for us to rather say: "The pH of this shampoo is 5,5."</p>

<p/>

<p>In the next activity, we are going to get to know the pH scale a little better.</p>

<p>We saw in the activity that lemon juice, which is more sour than orange juice, has a lower pH than orange juice. Does that mean that the relative pH of a substance will tell us <em>how</em> acidic or basic it is?</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-4">Can we measure how acidic or basic something is?</h3>
<p/>

<p>When we compared orange juice and lemon juice earlier, we learnt something important: The lower the pH of a substance, the more acidic it is. For bases we can state the folllowing: The higher the pH of a substance, the more basic it is.</p>

<p/>

<p>Here is a summary:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The closer to pH 1, the more strongly acidic the solution;</li>
<li>The closer to pH 14, the more strongly basic the solution; and</li>
<li>pH 7 is a neutral substance.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>We have learnt that the pH value of a substance tells us if it is an acid or a base. But how do we measure pH? One way to measure pH is with the help of acid-base indicators. Can you remember what they are? The next section will refresh your memory.</p>

<p/>

<p>We know that some substances change colour when they react with an acid or a base. These substances are called acid-base <strong>indicators</strong>, which can show us if a substance is an acid or a base.</p>

<p/>

<p>Different indicators change colour at different pH values. The table below shows a selection of acid-base indicators and the colours they will have at different pH values.</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idm1528128"><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0010.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>In Grade 7 we made and indicator from red cabbage and even made some <strong>red cabbage indicator</strong> paper. Can you find red cabbage water on the table above? In acids, the red cabbage water will turn red or pink. In neutral solutions it will be purple or violet. Which colours will the red cabbage indicator be when it is mixed with a base? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Blue, green or yellow</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>If red cabbage indicator is mixed with something that is only slightly basic, it will turn blue. If it is mixed with something that is strongly basic, it will turn yellow.</p>

<p/>

<p>When you look at the table above and you compare the information given for red cabbage water with the picture below, the colour changes you observed in the red cabbage water (in Grade 7) will make sense!</p>

</div>
<p/>

<p>You may recall that we also learnt about <strong>litmus</strong>, the most widely used of all acid-base indicators. Can you find litmus on the table of indicators?</p>

<p/>

<p>Litmus does not change colour in the presence of a neutral substance, but responds to acids and bases in the following way:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>litmus is red in the presence of an acid; and</li>
<li>litmus is blue in the presence of base.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Litmus can be bought as a solution or as litmus paper, although the paper is more commonly used.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0012.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Blue and red litmus paper.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>By changing to different colours in the presence of an acid or a base, indicators can show us if a substance is an acid or a base. In the next section we are going to learn about a special indicator that is so sensitive that it not only tells us whether a substance is an acid or a base, but also what its approximate pH is!</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-7">Universal indicator</h3>
<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>Video showing universal indicator<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PdprNTwb4Ks"></iframe></p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Unlike litmus, <strong>universal indicator</strong> can show us much more accurately how acidic or basic a solution is. Can you find universal indicator on the previous table of indicators? Universal indicator can change into a whole range of colours, depending on the pH of the solution. In the following picture, solutions of increasing pH were mixed with universal indicator to show its full range of colours.</p>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0013.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Universal indicator can have many different colours, from red for strong acids to dark purple for strong bases. The liquid inside the middle test tube is neutral (pH = 7) and this is shown by the green colour of the indicator.</figcaption></figure><p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Universal indicator solution can display so many colours is because it is actually a mixture of several different indicators.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Like litmus, universal indicator also comes in paper form, with the pH colour range of the indicator printed on the packaging.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong></p>

<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learner-dependent answer. They should note that universal indicator allows them to measure the pH of individual substances. By arranging the substances in order of increasing pH, they can rank the substances from most acidic to most basic. They should note that red cabbage indicator does give a range of colours with varying pH, but that it is not as effective as universal indicator for measuring pH.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>Something to think about:</strong> Extension question</p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What could we do to make red cabbage indicator suitable for measuring pH? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learners could discuss this question in class if there is time. The important thing here is that each of the colours of the red cabbage indicator needs to be standardised/linked to a specific pH value or range of values. Hence, if we had a range of samples of known pH, we could 'calibrate' the red cabbage solution, by mixing it with each of the pH standards and carefully noting the colour. This would allow us to produce a colour chart, that we could then use in the same way as the one that is available for universal indicator and other commercial indicators.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>In the last investigation we explored whether or not universal indicator paper or red cabbage indicator paper could tell us whether a substance is more acidic or basic than another. The advantage of using universal indicator over other indicators is that universal indicator can give us more accurate pH measurements. This is because it has different colours for different pH values. Most other indicators change colour only once or twice over the entire pH range.</p>
</div>

<p/>

<p>Many other colourful foods can be used to make acid-base indicators. Check out the diagram below for some examples. You could even try out a few of them at home!</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0015.png" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">pH indicators made from edible substances.</figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Measuring pH with indicator solutions or paper is easy, economical and convenient if we have only a few measurements to make. If we have many pH measurements to make, tearing and dipping paper strips and matching them up with a colour chart can become quite tedious and time-consuming.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>Universal indicators give a range of colours that can be used to determine the pH of a solution. Litmus paper can only indicate whether a solution is acidic, neutral or basic.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>What other quick and easy ways are there to measure pH?</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-8">How else can we measure pH?</h3>
<p/>

<p>Scientists use a pH meter to quickly and accurately measure the pH of a substance. While they are much more expensive to purchase than indicator paper or solution, they are a worthwhile investment for a laboratory that has to make many pH measurements daily and need these measurements to be done quickly.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0016.jpg" width="300"/></figure><figure><img src="images/gr9mm05-gd-0017.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">A portable pH meter.<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alkaline_pH.jpg">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alkaline_pH.jpg</a> </figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>A pH meter is an electronic instrument with a special sensor at the end that is sensitive to acids and bases. This is more accurate than the universal indicator. Help the scientist to read the pH of the solutions in the photos and classify them as acidic, neutral or basic!</p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The solution on the left has a pH of 7.053 so it is neutral. The solution on the right has a pH of 10.33 so it is basic.</p>

<p/>

<p>pH meters work as follows: When the sensor is dipped into the test solution, it sends a signal to the electronic circuitry of the pH meter, which is converted to a pH reading on a small LCD screen.</p>
</div>
