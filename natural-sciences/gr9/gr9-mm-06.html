<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>2 weeks</p>

<p>The central challenge of this chapter is to establish that acid-base reactions are <em>exchange</em> reactions. A fragment of the acid is exchanged with a fragment of the base and a salt and water are the resulting products of the reaction. The type of salt that forms depends on the identities of the acid and the base that were combined during the reaction.</p>

<p/>

<p>Once learners understand this, they have taken an important step to understanding acid-base chemistry. We will spend some time developing a frame for explaining this at the start of the chapter, to which we will return frequently.</p>

<p/>

<p>In light of the fact that learners have yet to learn about cations and anions, we have considered it pedagogically justifiable to make the following simplifications to currently accepted acid-base theory, in order to bring the concept of <em>exchange</em> across to the learners:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>Acids can be thought of as contributing H (instead of H+); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bases can be thought of as contributing O or OH (instead of O<sub>2</sub>- and OH-).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a combination of 2 H and 1 O, or alternatively 1 H and 1 OH.</p>
</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>We are well aware that writing H + OH &#8594; H<sub>2</sub>O has no meaning in science and for this reason we have avoided this usage in the text. But we do consider the use of simplified symbols (H instead of H+ and so forth) to have an advantage over their scientifically correct (but potentially confusing) counterparts in this context.</p>

<p/>

<p>There is also a danger that misconceptions and sloppy usage of symbols may result further down the line, when simplifying in this way. However, we feel these risks are counterbalanced by the greater likelihood of learners <em>understanding the concept of exchange</em> if the symbols they work with are not cluttered with additional information - like the charges on the ions - that have no meaning for them yet.</p>

<p/>

<p>Other skills that will be reinforced in this chapter are:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>writing chemical formulae;</li>
<li>converting between word equations and chemical equations; and</li>
<li>balancing chemical equations.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>A word of caution: Acid-base reactions are <em>neutralisation</em> reactions. However, this does not mean that the mixture of an acid with a base will be a neutral solution and you should avoid language that reinforces this notion. Even if equivalent quantities (stoichiometric quantities) of the acid and base are mixed - which would imply that both have been <em>neutralised</em> - the resulting solution will only be neutral (i.e. pH = 7) under very special circumstances. The reason is that not all salts are 'neutral substances'; in fact most salts have acid-base properties of their own. The chemistry required for learners to understand this is beyond them at this stage and will only be dealt with in Physical Sciences in Grade 12. Our suggestion is that you simply refrain from calling salts 'neutral substances'. If questions arise around the issue you could point out that the salts they will encounter in this chapter may 
be neutral substances, but that this is not true of all salts.</p>

<p/>

<p>Take note that although there is no section specifically named 'Applications' as indicated in CAPS, this content has rather been dealt with under other sections where it is more appropriate.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter we learnt about a new concept, namely pH. If we want to know whether something is an acid or a base, we can measure its pH:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Acids have pH values below 7. The lower the pH value, the more strongly acidic the substance.</li>
<li>Bases have pH values above 7. The higher the pH value, the more strongly basic the substance.</li>
<li>Neutral substances have pH equal to 7.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Another useful thing we learnt in the previous chapter is that we can use universal indicator to measure the pH of a solution. Universal indicator has different colours at different pH values. Below is a colour chart showing the range of colours for universal indicator and the pH values they correspond to. You will need it for all the activities of this chapter, because we are going to do lots of pH measurements!</p>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp2965488"><img src="images/gr9mm06-gd-0001.png" width="300"/></figure><p/>

<p>Can you remember how we used the universal indicator paper in the previous chapter? Here are some suggestions for the investigations of this chapter:</p>

<p/>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Before you start, place 1-cm lengths of universal indicator paper on a sheet of white paper, like this:</li>
</ol><figure id="gd-idm4869808"><img src="images/gr9mm06-gd-0002.png" width="300"/></figure><p>Later, if you want to write down a note or an observation, you can do so directly on the paper and copy it to your workbook afterwards.</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p/>

<p>Instead of dipping the paper in the solutions you are testing, use a glass rod or drinking straw to transfer a drop of the test solution to the indicator paper.</p>
<figure id="gd-idp63824"><img src="images/gr9mm06-gd-0003.png" width="300"/></figure></li>
</ol><p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>For some of the investigations in this chapter, you will be using droppers or syringes to measure out quantities. Tell learners that they may not use droppers or syringes to squirt water at other learners! There are many reasons why this is not a good idea. The most important reason is that the dropper or syringe <strong>may contain acid</strong>, that could end up in someone's eye where it could cause permanent damage or even blindness. So, squirting each other with the droppers or syringes <strong>is not allowed</strong>.</p>

<p/>

<p>What do you think would happen if we mixed an acid and a base? </p><hr/><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Get learners to discuss this in class or in small groups. Allow them to speculate and guide them to recall their Grade 7 learning: An acid will lose its potency when it is mixed with a base and vice versa. So the acid will be weakened by the base and the base will be weakened by the acid. 'Weaken', however, is a term best avoided, because 'weak' and 'strong' have very specific meanings when speaking about acids and bases. In a sense their acid-base properties will be destroyed, because they will be converted to products that won't be acids or bases. (Often the salt that results from the reaction between an acid and a base will have acid-base properties of its own, but we will not be discussing that now.)</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>We are going to do an investigation to find out. We are going to mix vinegar with baking soda. But first, a little revision: is vinegar an acid or a base? If you are not sure, imagine putting a drop of vinegar on your tongue. What would it taste like? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>It would taste sour, therefore it is an acid.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Is baking soda an acid or a base? If you are not sure, turn back to the previous chapter and look at the activity '<em>The pH scale'.</em> </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Baking soda is a base.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">The reaction between vinegar and baking soda</h1>
<p/>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Quantities for this investigation are as follows: Every 1 g of baking soda will require approximately 15 ml of vinegar for complete neutralisation. We recommend that you measure out 1 teaspoon of baking soda and approximately 50 ml vinegar for each group.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The purpose of this experiment is to investigate how the pH changes when vinegar is added to baking soda.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>baking soda</li>
<li>vinegar</li>
<li>water</li>
<li>glass beaker or small yoghurt tub</li>
<li>universal indicator paper (cut into 1 cm strips)</li>
<li>sheet of white printer paper</li>
<li>plastic teaspoon</li>
</ul><p/>

<p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Prepare the universal indicator paper by neatly placing five 1-cm pieces underneath each other on the sheet of paper.</li>
<li>Place one teaspoon of baking soda in the beaker or yoghurt tub.</li>
<li>Add approximately 10 teaspoons of water to the baking soda.</li>
<li>Use the teaspoon to stir the solution until all the baking soda has dissolved. We will be calling this the 'test solution' from now on.</li>
<li>Transfer one drop of the test solution to the first piece of universal indicator paper using the teaspoon or a straw.</li>
<li>Compare the colour of the paper with the colour guide given at the start of the chapter, to find the pH of the solution. Record this pH in your results table.</li>
<li>Add 1 teaspoon of the vinegar to the test solution. Stir it gently and transfer another drop of the solution to a fresh strip of the universal indicator.</li>
<li>Read the pH of the solution off the colour guide and record it in your results table.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the pH of the test solution drops below 7. You may need more than 5 pieces of universal indicator paper.</li>
</ol><p/>

<p><strong>RESULTS:</strong></p>

<p>Present your results in a neat table. Use appropriate headings for your table. 'Number of teaspoons of vinegar added' and 'Colour of the universal indicator paper' and 'pH of the test solution' are suggested headings for your columns. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<p/>

<p>Draw a line graph to illustrate your results. What will be on the x-axis and what will be on the y-axis? Give your graph a heading. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Learners must draw a graph with the 'number of teaspoons of vinegar added' on the x-axis (independent variable) and the pH of the solution on the y-axis (dependent variable).</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong></p>

<p>What conclusions can be made from the results of your investigation? Here you can rewrite your hypothesis, but change it to reflect your findings if they are different from what you predicted earlier.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><p>Were you able to confirm or reject your hypothesis?</p>

<p/><hr/></div>

<p/>

<p>In this investigation, you probably noticed that the pH of the mixture dropped every time you added more vinegar to the baking soda! Why did this happen?</p>

<p/>

<p>When an acid and a base are mixed (in the right amounts), they will <strong>neutralise</strong> each other. That means that, together, they will change into something that is neither an acid nor a base. So, the acid will lose its 'acidity' and the base will lose its 'basicity'.</p>

<p/>

<p>What have we learnt so far? We have learnt that acids and bases neutralise each other:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p>If we add a base to an acid, the pH of the resulting solution will increase, because the acid will lose some of its <strong>potency</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>If we add an acid to a base, the opposite will happen. The pH will decrease, because the base will lose some of its potency.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>What are the products of an acid-base reaction? Can we predict what they will be?</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">The products of acid-base reactions</h3>
<p/>

<p>In order to understand how an acid-base reaction works, we have to take a quick <strong>detour</strong> and say something about <strong>exchange reactions</strong>. Acid-base reactions are exchange reactions.</p>

<p/>

<p>In the reaction below, two substances AB and CD are undergoing an exchange reaction:</p>

<p/>

<p>AB + CD &#8594; AD + CB</p>

<p/>

<p>Can you see that A and C have exchanged partners so that A is now combined with D, while C combined with B?</p>

<p/>

<p>What does this have to do with acids and bases? Well, acids and bases undergo exchange reactions too. Here are some examples. See if you can figure out which parts have exchanged with which.</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p/>

<p><strong>HCl + NaOH &#8594; NaCl + HOH</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>In the above equation HOH should actually be written: H<sub>2</sub>O. The reaction equation becomes:</p>

<p><strong>HCl + NaOH &#8594; NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>or, in words:</p>

<p><strong>hydrochloric acid + sodium hydroxide</strong>
         &#8594;<strong>sodium chloride + water</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>In this example, the following happened:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the acid gave its H towards making a water molecule;</li>
<li>the base gave OH towards making a water molecule; and</li>
<li>the Na from the base and the Cl from the acid combined to form a salt.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p/>

<p><strong>2 HCl + MgO &#8594; MgCl<sub>2</sub> + HOH</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>In the above equation HOH should actually be written: H<sub>2</sub>O. The reaction equation becomes:</p>

<p><strong>2 HCl + MgO &#8594; MgCl<sub>2</sub> + H
            <sub>2</sub>O</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>or, in words:</p>

<p><strong>hydrochloric acid + magnesium oxide</strong>
            &#8594;<strong>magnesium chloride + water</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>In this example, the following happened:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>the acid gave 2 H towards making a water molecule;</li>
<li>the base gave OH towards making a water molecule; and</li>
<li>the Mg from the base and the 2 Cl from the acid combined to form a salt.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Acid-base reactions always produce water and a salt. In both of the examples above the general equation was:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>acid + base &#8594; salt + water</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>There is one class of acid-base reactions that produces an additional product, but we will learn more about that later.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="takenote">
<p>In Grade 11 you will learn that the mechanisms of these reactions are actually slightly more complex than this, but for now, understanding it at this level is good enough.</p>

<p/>

<p>In the next sections will discuss the classes of substances that are typically acids or bases. Two important things to remember are the following:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>Non-metal oxides form acidic solutions when they are dissolved in water.</li>
<li>Metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal carbonates all form basic solutions when they are dissolved in water.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>First, we will look at the non-metal oxides.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-5">Non-metal oxides form acidic solutions</h3>
<p/>

<p>Can you name a few non-metal oxides? Write down their formulae. If you are not sure you can take a peek at the Periodic Table and pick a few non-metals from the right-hand side of the table. Add oxygen and you have a non-metal oxide! </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub></p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>How do we know that non-metal oxides form acidic solutions? Experiments have shown this.</p>

<p/>

<p>You may not know this, but when CO<sub>2</sub> gas is bubbled through water some of it dissolves in the water to form carbonic acid. Here is the reaction equation:</p>

<p>CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &#8594; H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></p>

<p/>

<p>To see this happen, try the following quick activity.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">CO<sub>2</sub>  bubbled through water</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>A variation of this activity is if you have liquid universal indicator, you can add it to the tap water at the start to show the pH is 7 (it should be green). Then as you blow into the water, the universal indicator will change colour. Make sure you use a clear glass so learners can observe the colour change as it becomes more yellow. This links to the next activity on acid rain and how it forms.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>MATERIALS:</strong></p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>tap water</li>

<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Carbonic acid is added to soft drinks to make it fizzy. The carbonic acid decomposes and forms carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The pH of the solution is now below 7 because it contains carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). Carbonic acid is not a very strong acid, but still acidic enough to have a pH lower than 7.</p>

<p/>

<p>When sulfur dioxide (a gas) is bubbled through water it dissolves in the water to form an acid called sulfurous acid:</p>

<p>SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &#8594; H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub></p>

<p/>

<p>These are two of the reactions that produce a phenomenon called <strong>acid rain</strong>. SO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> are released as waste products from factories and power stations. For example, burning wood and fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases then dissolve in water droplets in the atmosphere to form acids, in a similar way that the CO<sub>2</sub> in your breath dissolved in the water in the last activity to produce an acidic solution. When it rains, these acids are present in the raindrops that fall back to earth. Sulfurous acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) is strong enough to damage plant life and to acidify water sources.</p>

<p/><p>The impacts include:</p>

          <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>damage of plant life, both wilderness areas and also crops, depending on where the rain falls</li>
<li>the rain leaches into soil and makes it more acidic; this kills microorganisms living in the soil, damages plants further by contaminating soil water</li>
<li>the rain can fall into various water sources and also run off into water sources such as rivers, lakes and dams; this causes the water to become more acidic; aquatic animals and plants can die; human water sources become too acidic as well</li>

Explain your answer. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Learners need to justify their answers. They may say that it helps the local environment as the gases are carried further away and therefore do not pollute the town or city that the factory is in or near. But this does not do anything to minimize the acid rain that could potentially form as the same amount of gases are still emitted; they are just carried further away. The acid rain therefore can still form and fall on the vegetation and areas outside of the towns and cities.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>There are several solutions to minimizing the formation of acid rain. For example, coal-powered stations can use filters and other processes in their smoke towers to remove sulfur gases before the smoke is released into the atmosphere. Countries can take bigger steps by signing treaties to reduce their sulfur and other greenhouse gas emissions. The move towards using renewable energy sources will also help to reduce the reliance on coal and other fossil fuels, thereby reducing the emission of acid-producing gases into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>We have now learnt about non-metal oxides, but what about metal oxides? What kind of solutions do they form in water? We will find out more about them and other metal compounds in the next section.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-6">Metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal carbonates form basic solutions</h3><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Metal oxides</h4>
<p>Do you remember learning about some of the metal oxides in Chapter 3? We already learnt these rules to write the formulae of metal oxides.</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p><strong>Metal oxides from group 1 on the Periodic Table will have the formula M<sub>2</sub>O, where M represents any metal.</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>What do you think the pH will be of a solution of a metal oxide in water? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The pH will be above 7.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The next class of compounds that form basic solutions in water are the metal hydroxides.</p></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Metal hydroxides</h4>
<p>A metal hydroxide forms when a metal reacts with water. A metal hydroxide has the general formula MOH or M(OH)<sub>2</sub>. In the formula, M represents a metal atom, O represents an oxygen atom and H represents a hydrogen atom.</p>

<p/>

<p>To know whether the MOH or M(OH)<sub>2</sub> will be the correct formula, here are two simple rules for you to remember:</p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>

<p/>

<p>The final class of compounds that forms basic solutions in water is the metal carbonates. Baking soda is a special kind of carbonate, called a <strong>bicarbonate</strong> (or hydrogen carbonate). You may remember that it was one of the bases we tested with universal indicator earlier.</p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h4 class="title">Metal carbonates</h4>
<p>A metal carbonate has the general formula MCO<sub>3</sub> or M<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. In the formula, M represents a metal atom, C represents a carbon atom and O represents an oxygen atom.</p>

<p/>

<p>To know whether the MCO<sub>3</sub> or M<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> will be the correct formula, there are two simple rules to remember:</p>

<li>hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution (0.1 M)</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Notes for the investigation:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>
<p><strong>Learners must not dilute hydrochloric acid themselves</strong> as it reacts strongly with water. Make sure to add the acid slowly to the water and <strong>NOT</strong> the other way around.</p>
</li>
<li>To prepare 0.1 M HCl solution, carefully add approximately 10 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid (33% or 11 M) to 1 liter of tap water. It is recommended that you wear safety goggles and protective gloves during this step and that you rinse away any acid spills with cold tap water. Since this is just a qualitative experiment, it is not necessary to use distilled water for the solution. It is also not required that you measure the volumes with extreme accuracy.</li>
<li>The following guide will help you to determine quantities: The magnesium oxide prepared from a 1 cm length of magnesium ribbon will require approximately 8 ml of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid for complete neutralisation. If the learners work in small groups and each group dissolves a small quantity of MgO (the size of a match head) in 2 ml of water, they will only need a few drops of HCl solution to neutralise all the MgO.</li>
<li>
<p>If you have universal indicator <strong>solution</strong>, this will work very nicely as you can observe the colour changes as you add the drops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you decide to give the learners droppers to measure out the HCl, you will have to enforce very strict rules for handling the droppers. Learners find the temptation to squirt water at each other very difficult to resist and they must be made aware of the <strong>hazards of accidentally squirting acid</strong> at another learner.</p>
</li>
<li>Remind learners to use the colour guide for universal indicator provided at the start of the chapter. If you have the budget, a good idea would be to make a number of colour photocopies of the chart and to have them laminated so they will last longer.</li>
<li>Remind learners to prepare a table for their results beforehand. </li>
</ul><p/>
</div>
<p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>Prepare the universal indicator paper by neatly placing five 1 cm pieces in a column on the white tile or sheet of printer paper.</li>
<li>Place a small quantity (the size of a match head) of the magnesium oxide in a test tube.</li>
<li>Add approximately 2 ml of tap water to dissolve most of the magnesium oxide.</li>
<li>
<p>Use the glass rod (or plastic straw) to stir the solution until most the magnesium oxide has dissolved. We will be calling this the <em>test solution</em> from now on.</p>
</li>
<li>Transfer one drop of the test solution to the first piece of universal indicator paper.</li>
<li>Compare the colour of the paper with the colour guide to find the pH of the solution.</li>
<li>Record this pH in the table you prepared beforehand.</li>
<li>Add 10 drops of the hydrochloric acid solution to the test solution. Stir it gently and transfer another drop of the solution to a fresh strip of the universal indicator.</li>
<li>Read the pH of the solution off the colour guide and record it in your table.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the pH of the test solution drops below 7. You may need more than 5 pieces of universal indicator paper.</li>

<div class="teachers-guide">
<p>The number of drops of HCl should be on the x-axis of the graph and pH should be on the y-axis. There should be a general trend downwards (since acid is added to a base, we can expect the pH to drop), but it should not be linear. This experiment is a very rudimentary 'titration' and an example of a titration curve from this experiment is given here:</p>

<p/>

<p/>
<figure id="gd-idp2650368"><img src="images/gr9mm06-gd-0010.jpg" width="300"/></figure><p>It is therefore not expected that learners' curves will be linear, but rather that there will be a gradual decline in pH at first, followed by a rapid drop when all the base has been neutralised. After this the curve levels out again.</p>

<p>The general word equation for the reaction between an acid and a base is:</p>

<p><strong>acid + base &#8594; salt + water</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>Since the base in our reaction is a metal oxide we can write:</p>

<p><strong>acid + <u>metal oxide</u> &#8594; salt + water</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>This is the general word equation for the reaction between an acid and a metal oxide. The type of salt that forms will depend on the specific acid and metal oxide which were used in the reaction.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-9">Equations for the reaction between magnesium oxide and hydrochloric acid</h3>
<p/>

<p>Now we are going to learn how to write equations for our actual reaction.</p>

<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Writing the chemical equation</h1>
<p><strong>The following steps will guide you:</strong></p>

</div><div class="solution">
<p/><p/>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Write what remains of the base (MgO) after we have taken away the O (to make water).

<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>MgCl<sub>2</sub></p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Now, let's put it all together, first the reactants, then the products:</p>

<p><strong>2 HCl + MgO &#8594; MgCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</strong></p>

<p/>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p/>

<p>Let's check quickly if the reaction is balanced.</p>


            <div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">How many H atoms on the left hand side and on the right hand side? Are they balanced?

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>1 O atoms left and 1 O atoms right. The O's are balanced.</p>
</div></div></div></div>
</li>
</ol><p/>

<p>Since the numbers of each type of atom is the same on either side of the equation, we can confirm that it is balanced.</p>

<p/>
</div>

<p/>

<p>Finally, let's use the chemical equation to write a word equation for the reaction:</p>

<p><strong>acid + metal carbonate &#8594; salt + water + carbon dioxide</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>The type of salt that forms will depend on the specific acid and metal carbonate which were used in the reaction.</p></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-15">Equations for the reaction between calcium carbonate and hydrochloric acid</h3>

<p/>

<p>Finally, let's use the chemical equation to write a word equation for the reaction:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>hydrochloric acid + calcium carbonate &#8594; calcium chloride + water + carbon dioxide</strong></p>

<p/></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-16">Applications for calcium carbonate</h3>
<p/>

<p>Calcium carbonate is found in many places outside of the laboratory. It is found in different types of rocks around the world, for example limestone, chalk and marble.</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm06-gd-0014.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/russelljsmith/3604339900/"/><figcaption class="caption">The Cango Caves near Oudtshoorn, South Africa, are situated in a limestone ridge and contain spectacular limestone formations. Such caves are the result of water high in carbonic acid acting upon limestone deposits in ancient rock layers. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/russelljsmith/3604339900/"> http://www.flickr.com/photos/russelljsmith/3604339900/ </a></figcaption></figure><p/>

<p>Calcium carbonate is also the main part of shells of various marine organisms, snails, pearls, oysters and bird eggshells. It is also found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans (such as crabs, prawns and lobsters).</p>

<p/>
<figure><img src="images/gr9mm06-gd-0015.jpg" width="300"/><figcaption class="caption">Chunks of calcium carbonate from various shells.</figcaption></figure><p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
<p>Dark green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, kale and cabbage are a dietary source of calcium carbonate, providing the body with calcium. You can also take calcium carbonate in the form of tablet supplements.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Calcium carbonate also has many applications. In industry, the main application is in construction as it is used in various building materials and in cement. Calcium carbonate is used in many adhesives, paints and in ceramics. It is also used in swimming pools to adjust the pH. When do you think it would be added? If the pool was too acidic and you wanted to make it more basic, or if the pool was too basic and you wanted to make it more acidic? </p><hr/><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>CaCO<sub>3</sub> forms a basic solution in water so it is used if the pH is too low (too acidic) and you want to make the pool water more basic.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>Calcium carbonate is also used in agriculture in the form of lime powder. Agricultural lime is made by grinding up limestone or chalk. It is added to the soil if the soil is too acidic to increase the pH. It also provides plants with a source of calcium.</p>

<p>In this chapter we have investigated a number of reactions of acids with bases. We have learnt to write word equations for these reactions and practised converting between word and balanced chemical equations.</p>

<p/></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title" id="toc-id-17">Summary</h2><div class="note col-md-10" data-type="keyconcepts"><ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>The reaction of an acid with a base is called a neutralisation reaction.</li>
<li>When an acid (pH  7), the pH of the resulting mixture will lie somewhere between that of the acid and the base. Even though the acid and base will be neutralised, the resulting solution will not necessarily be neutral.</li>
