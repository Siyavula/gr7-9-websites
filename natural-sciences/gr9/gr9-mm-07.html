<p><strong>Chapter overview</strong></p>

<p>0.5 week</p>

<p>This is a short chapter to conclude the series of reactions that learners will have been exposed to this term. The last reactions to look at are those between an acid and a metal. At the end of this chapter, there is a short activity on some of the careers in the chemical industry. Although this is not for assessment purposes, if you do not have time to do it in class, we encourage you to encourage or get your learners to do it as a homework activity. Seeing the real world application for what they learn in the classroom is a very important part of the learning process and in discovering what is possible through science and technology.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter we learnt about the reactions of acids with a variety of bases: metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metal carbonates. We learnt how to write general equations, word equations and chemical equations for those reactions.</p>

<p/>

<p>In this chapter we will investigate one final type of reaction, namely the reaction between an acid and a metal.</p>

<p/>

<p>First, we will do an investigation to observe the reaction and then we will write equations to represent it. Before we do this, however, we have to take a quick detour to learn something interesting about hydrogen gas.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Testing for hydrogen gas</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>This activity introduces the test for hydrogen gas. It is <strong>optional,</strong> however, the test will be sued in the following investigation so if you do not do this activity in class, a suggestion is for learners to do it in their own time, or to just explain the hydrogen test briefly before proceeding to the investigation.</p>
</div>
<p/>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What do you know about hydrogen gas? Perhaps you know its formula? Write it below.

</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Hydrogen gas is a <strong>diatomic</strong> gas. What does this mean?</p>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>That means each molecule of hydrogen gas consists of two H atoms.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What do you know about the position of hydrogen in the periodic table? Write what you know in the space below. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Hydrogen can be found in the top left hand corner of the periodic table.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>The position of hydrogen in the periodic table tells us that it is the lightest of all the elements. It has the smallest atomic mass. Because the element hydrogen is a gas (even though it is a diatomic one), it has one of the lowest densities of any substance. Can you remember what <strong>density</strong> means? Write your own definition below.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Density is the mass of a substance in a given space (volume).</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
        
<p/>

<p>When hydrogen gas is released in a reaction it will immediately rise up, because <strong>hydrogen is less dense than air</strong>. If you filled a balloon with hydrogen, it would float up and you would need to tie a string to it to prevent it from floating away!</p>

        
<p/>

        <figure><img src="images/gr9mm07-gd-0001.jpg" width="300" alt="http://www.flickr.com/photos/noaaphotolib/5083799912/"/><figcaption class="caption">This man is about to launch a weather balloon filled with hydrogen gas.

You may remember learning about this in Chapter 4 about the reactions of non-metals with oxygen. The reaction between a large quantity of hydrogen and oxygen in the air produces a beautiful orange fireball and a very loud boom! Do you remember seeing the following diagram?</p>

<p>The reaction between a tiny amount of hydrogen and oxygen in the air produces a <strong>characteristic</strong> 'pop' sound and this serves as test for the <strong>presence</strong> of hydrogen. You can watch the short video clip in the visit box in the margin to see this 'pop'.</p>

<p>The name hydrogen comes from the Greek words <em>'hydro</em>' and '<em>gen</em>' which means 'water generator'</p>

<p/>

<p>Let's now investigate the reaction between an acid and a metal. You should listen carefully for this 'pop' sound during the investigation. If you hear it, it will signal the presence of hydrogen gas!</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Investigation"><h1 class="title">The reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid</h1><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>It is recommended that you demonstrate this reaction to learners. There are many ways to perform this demonstration and if you have a tried and trusted method, you should use it by all means. For example, a simple method is to place diluted HCl in a test tube, add a piece of magnesium and then bring a glowing splint to the neck of the test tube so that it goes 'pop' in the presence of the hydrogen gas that is produced. The method we have included here does not require anything too complicated and it has the added fun aspect of blowing hydrogen bubbles and popping them with a candle flame.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p>The purpose of this investigation is to:</p>
<ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>observe the reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium; and</li>
<li>identify the gaseous product of the reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium.</li>
</ul><p/>

<p>Your teacher will demonstrate the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid, while you make observations. Remember to watch carefully and take detailed notes.</p>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>One possible question would be: What products will form when magnesium reacts with hydrochloric acid?</p>

<p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What do you predict will happen? Your hypothesis should be a prediction of the finding(s) of the investigation. You should write it in the form of a possible answer to the investigative question(s). 
<p/>

<p/><hr/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Some ideas:</p>

        <ul data-class="ListBulleted"><li>When magnesium reacts with hydrochloric acid, a gas is released.</li>
<li>When magnesium reacts with hydrochloric acid, hydrogen gas is released. </li>

<li>shallow dish filled with soapy water (made by mixing a few teaspoons of dishwashing liquid with water)</li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>To prepare dilute hydrochloric acid solution, slowly and carefully add approximately 100 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid (33% or 11 M) to 900 ml of cold tap water. It is recommended that you wear safety goggles and protective gloves during this step and that you rinse away any acid spills with cold tap water. Since this is just a qualitative experiment, it is not necessary to use distilled water for the solution. It is also not required that you measure the volumes with extreme accuracy. Be careful when handling this solution; even though it is dilute it can still cause burns.</p>

<p>The quantities for this experiment are as follows: 1 g of magnesium will require approximately 42 ml of 1M hydrochloric acid to be consumed. Just more than 900 ml of hydrogen gas will be produced by these quantities of reactants.</p>
</div>
<p/>

<p><strong>METHOD:</strong></p>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Use a piece of universal indicator paper to test the pH of the hydrochloric acid solution. Record its pH.

<p>In our investigation hydrochloric acid reacted with magnesium (a metal). Our next task is to write an equation for the reaction. We will begin by writing a general equation and end with one that matches the reaction that we have just investigated.</p>

<p/>
<div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-2">General equation for the reaction of an acid with a metal</h3>
<p/>

<p>The general word equation for the reaction between an acid and a metal is:</p>

<p><strong>acid + metal &#8594; salt + hydrogen gas</strong></p>

<p/>

<p>The type of salt that forms will depend on the specific metal and acid which are used in the reaction.</p>

<p/>
<div class="note col-md-6" data-type="visit">
<p>A video and simulation that teaches you more about the reactions of acids with metals<a data-class="ExternalLink" href="http://bit.ly/1eDGii7">bit.ly/1eDGii7</a></p>
</div></div><div class="section"><h3 class="title" id="toc-id-3">Equations for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid</h3>
<p/>

<p>Now, let's write equations for our actual reaction from the last investigation.</p>

<p/>
<div class="activity" data-type="Activity"><h1 class="title">Writing the chemical equation</h1>
<p/>

<p><strong>The following steps will guide you:</strong></p>

<p/>
<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">The acid of our reaction was hydrochloric acid. Can you write its chemical formula? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>HCl</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">What is the name and formula of the metal we used? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>Magnesium (Mg)</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">Now, let's try to predict the products of the reaction. We know that hydrogen gas will be one of the products. Write the chemical formula for hydrogen gas. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>H<sub>2</sub></p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">
<p>Write what remains of the acid (HCl) after we have taken away the H to make H<sub>2</sub>. (Remember we need two H to make one H<sub>2</sub>).</p>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>2 Cl</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">The two Cl's and the Mg are exactly what are needed to make magnesium chloride. Write the formula below. 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>MgCl<sub>2</sub></p>
</div></div></div></div>
<ol data-class="ListEnumerated"><li>
<p/>

<p>Now, let's write the reaction; first the reactants, then the products:</p>

            
<p><strong>2 HCl + Mg &#8594; MgCl<sub>2</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub></strong></p>

          
<p>Let's check quickly if the reaction is balanced.</p>

<div class="exercises"><div class="problemset"><div class="entry"><div class="problem">How many H on the left and right? Are they balanced? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>2 H left and 2 H right. The H's are balanced.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">How many Cl on the left and right? Are they balanced? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>2 Cl left and 2 Cl right. The Cl's are balanced.</p>
</div></div><div class="entry"><div class="problem">How many Mg on the left and right? Are they balanced? 
<p/>

<p/><hr/></div><div class="solution">
<p/><p>1 Mg left and 1 Mg right. The Mg's are balanced.</p>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Since the numbers of each type of atom is the same on either side of the equation, we can confirm that it is balanced.</p>
</li>
</ol><p/>
</div>

<p/>

<p>Finally, let's use the chemical equation to write a word equation for the reaction:</p>

<p/>

<p><strong>hydrochloric acid + magnesium &#8594; magnesium chloride + hydrogen gas</strong></p>

<p>This section is not for assessment purposes and you may be inclined to leave it out. However, we strongly encourage you to give your learners the opportunity to discover the applications of what they are learning in class in the world around them, even if only as a homework exercise. It is very important for learners to realise that what they learn in class extends far beyond the walls of your classroom. Encourage them to be curious!</p>

<p>When people hear that someone is a <strong>'chemist'</strong>, they often confuse this with being a <strong>'pharmacist'</strong>. In some countries the terms 'chemist' and 'pharmacist' are even used to describe the same kind of person. In South Africa the two words have different meanings. But what is the difference between being a chemist and being a pharmacist?</p>

<p/>

<p>Look up these careers to identify the main difference between a chemist and a pharmacist and summarise them below:</p>

<p>Chemists are people who have studied chemistry and can use their specialist knowledge of chemical reactions to produce new materials and compounds. These could be new medicines, innovative building materials, new fuels that do not harm the environment and many others.</p>

<p><strong>Pharmacists:</strong></p>

<p/><hr/><hr/></li>
</ul><div class="teachers-guide">
<p>Pharmacists also study chemistry, but combine this with other subjects like pharmacology, physiology and biochemistry. Pharmacists are health professionals and have specialist training in the health sciences as well as the chemical sciences. Their key responsibility is to ensure the safe and effective use of pharmaceutical drugs. They use their knowledge of medicines and the human body to dispense prescriptions from a licensed pharmacy. Job opportunities for pharmacists also include clinical services, reviewing medications for safety and efficacy and providing drug information where it is needed.</p>

<p>This is an <strong>optional</strong> activity, which is not for assessment. A suggestion is that if you do not have time to do it in class, learners should still be encouraged to do it outside of class as it is important that they see how and where chemistry can take them after school.</p>
