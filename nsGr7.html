          <p>Let's start exploring the world around us and how it works! Remember that this is your book! You must use it to explore and ask questions about the world around you, and also to learn about yourself and who you are. Do not be afraid to take notes in the margins of this book - make your own scribbles and notes to yourself about points to remember or questions you would like to ask. Be curious! Explore and imagine the possibilities of what you can do with science!</p>

              Have you heard the word 'sphere' before? Do you know what it means? A sphere is normally used when talking about a round shape (like a ball). Now, what do we mean when we talk about the <strong>biosphere</strong>? The prefix 'bio-' indicates something to do with life. For example, 'biology' is the study of living organisms. So, can you put these two meanings together to work out what 'biosphere' means?
            </p>
            
            
            
            <p>The biosphere is the place where life exists on planet Earth. When we talk about the biosphere, we are talking about a huge system (the whole world!) and how all the different parts work together to support life. We will look at these different parts in more detail a bit later.</p>
            
            
            <div class="note col-md-6" data-type="didyouknow">
              <p>
                The first person to use the term 'biosphere' was the geologist Eduard Suess in 1875 when he wrote a definition for the biosphere as 'the place on Earth's surface where life dwells<em>.</em>'

            <p>
              We can also use the term biosphere in different ways. When we speak of all life on Earth as it interacts with the non-living rocks and soil, water and air (<strong>atmosphere</strong>), we call this the biosphere.

              We can also call a specific part or region on Earth that supports life, a biosphere, especially when we refer to the living organisms and the <strong>environments</strong> in which they live.

            <p>After doing this activity, did you see that life exists everywhere on Earth? From the highest mountains to the deepest oceans, from the hottest deserts to the thickest jungles, there is life. Did you also notice that when describing the places on Earth where life exists, you used words such as soil, rocks, water, air? These are all part of the biosphere and have special names.</p>

                          <p>This questions is deliberately included to elicit debate. Without the atmosphere life as we know it would not be possible. The oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lower layers of the troposphere (that touches Earth) allow life to exist as organisms can respire and plants can photosynthesise. The atmosphere also helps to keep the Earth warm by trapping solar energy. The atmosphere protects life from too much UV radiation from the Sun. Earth is the only planet in our solar system that can support life, due in part to our atmosphere.</p>

                    The word 'aquatic' is used to describe something to do with water. Therefore aquaticanimals are animals that live in or near water. The word<strong>marine</strong>describes organisms that live in saltwater or the sea. So someone studying the organisms in the sea is called a marine biologist.

                    <p>A frequent misconception is that plants get larger and grow because of nutrients they absorb from the soil. However most of the organic mass from any plant is from carbon dioxide that is captured during photosynthesis and used to make organic molecules. It is important to stress that the main nutrient obtained from the soil is water, and relatively small amounts of minerals. If plants 'took up' the actual soil then one would expect it to be depleted and there would be large craters around every large tree!</p>

Each of the organisms that we have seen so far needs to be able to stay alive in those specific conditions. We say they need to <strong>adapt</strong> to live in their particular habitat. What does it mean to stay alive though?

                        All living things need to be able to <strong>move</strong>. Moving does not have to consist of big movements. Even plants move, for example as the flowers and leaves turn to face the sun during the course of the day.

                        All living things need energy to perform the life processes. Organisms release energy from their food by a process called <strong>cellular respiration</strong>.

                        All living things need to be <strong>sensitive</strong> to their environment. Think of an example of why animals need to sense their environment and write it down below.

In order to stay alive these living organisms <strong>require</strong> (need) certain things or specific conditions. In this section we are going to study the requirements necessary to <strong>sustain</strong> life.

            <p>When groups are finished discussing their most important requirements, let groups share their lists with the other groups and have a class discussion. List their answers on the board and make a tick for each one that is repeated - for example Food/ Oxygen/ Water might be repeated so each time it repeats make a tick next to it. This way they will quickly be able to see which requirements are most commonly repeated in the class. Learners might identify 'Food' rather than energy. Remind them that they also have to think about the plants which do not need to eat food. So ask the learners what term they could use as a more general term for food? This links back to nutrition in the seven life processes. The answer is that living things need a source of energy. If learners do not come up with the fact that living things need 'favourable/good/optimal temperatures', ask them some leading questions such as: 'Do you think the space station needs to be heated or cooled? Why? Will 
              the humans and plants be able to survive at the temperature it is on the Moon? ' etc.

        <p>Living organisms require certain conditions or things to be able to stay alive. We say that these things or conditions sustain life.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>You would have discussed some of these requirements in the last activity. Did you come up with the same or similar requirements? Living organisms require the following to survive:</p>
        <ul data-class="ListBulleted">
          <li>energy</li>
          <li>gases</li>

        </ul>
        
        
        <p>Next, we look at these in a bit more detail.</p>

          <strong>Energy</strong>: All living organisms need energy to stay alive and perform the life processes. Plants need energy from sunlight in order to photosynthesise. Other organisms get their energy from the food that they eat.

          <strong>Gases</strong>: All living things require oxygen for cellular respiration. Oxygen is used to release energy from nutrients and carbon dioxide and water is produced as a waste product of respiration. Green plants also need carbon dioxide to photosynthesise.

          <p>In previous grades learners were required to complete a similar investigation to determine the optimal requirements for seeds to grow. CAPS suggests that they do this activity again in order to reinforce the concept of the requirements to sustain life. Teachers should gauge how many learners did this particular activity in previous grades and should explain that this repetition is not so much to find out what requirements are necessary to sustain life, but to give them an opportunity to learn how to conduct a science investigation. This has therefore been included again as a very good opportunity (with learners already aware of the outcome) to review the scientific method and allow learners to practise this.</p>

            <strong>VARIABLES:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Scientists often use investigations to search for cause and effect relationships. This means that they design experiments to investigate how changes to one part will cause an effect on another. These changing quantities are called <strong>variables</strong>. There are usually three kinds of variables:
          </p>
          <ol data-class="ListEnumerated">
            <li>
              <strong>Independent variables:</strong> This is the thing that you are changing in the investigation. You are in control of the independent variable. For example, if you wanted to investigate if eating a lot of sugar makes you gain weight, then the amount of sugar you eat is the independent variable. You control how much sugar you eat. We want to achieve something called a FAIR TEST which means that only ONE independent variable is changed at one time. Once the independent variable has been changed the scientist then observes what the effect will be. In the example of investigating if sugar makes you gain weight, you cannot at the same time investigate whether exercise makes you lose weight. This would not be a fair test.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dependent variables:</strong> The dependent variable is the thing that you observe in an investigation. You do not change it. The dependent variable will change depending on the independent variable. For example, in the investigation to see if eating a lot of sugar makes you gain weight, then the dependent variable will be how many kilograms you gain (or lose) as a result of eating sugar. How much weight you gain depends on how much sugar you ate. Dependent variables should be measured in an objective way using numbersas far as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Controlled variables:</strong> These are the quantities that a scientist wants to remain the same or unchanged throughout the experiment. The controlled variable needs to be carefully monitored to make sure that it stays the same. In the example to see if sugar makes you gain weight, you could have one person eat a lot of sugar and the other person eat no sugar and then see the changes in weight. There are some things that need to stay the same for both of these people so that it is a fair test. For example, both people must do the same amount of exercise so that this does not influence their weight. This is a controlled variable.
            </li>
            
          </ol>
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Stress to the learners that dependent variables should be measured using NUMBERS as far as possible, as this leads to tables and graphs. They should avoid subjective evaluations like it 'looks good' or 'feels nice'. This is not science.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>Ask learners if they can think of any other variables that need to be kept the same in this example. They might think of things like the starting weight of the people should be the same, they should be the same sex, same age, they should both be healthy and not sick etc.</p>
          </div>
          
          
          <p>You can also do a control test. For example, in this investigation about the growth of plants, you will be taking away one of the requirements for growth. You need to do a control test where another plant is given all the requirements, including the one you took away in the other plant. You can then compare your plant where you took one requirement away to the control plant which has that requirement to see if there is a difference.</p>
          
          
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>You, the teacher, can decide how you want to conduct this investigation. Perhaps learners can just assess whether it germinates or not, or they can look at how tall the plant grows, how many leaves it grows, etc. In most cases, the seeds probably will not germinate and grow if put in a cupboard or fridge or not given any water. So the best test is just to see whether it germinates or not.</p>

                  <p>Learners need to explain how they will keep the other factors the same in each case but only change one at a time. It is important that learners understand and reflect on having a control group that has all the necessary factors/requirements to allow it to grow.

            <p>The above questions give learners the opportunity to reflect on their variables and control groups. As Gr. 7s might not have had a chance to work with these concepts it is imperative that you spend time explaining why a control group is required and why only one variable be changed in each of the plants. Use the above example of testing whether eating too much sugar makes you put on weight, so that learners can then apply what you discuss about the example to this investigation.</p>

            <strong>METHOD:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>In your group, plan how you are going to do the investigation. Think about which requirement you are testing and how you will take this requirement away. For example, if you are looking at light, where could you place the seeds so that they do not receive light? Remember, if you are looking at light, then you need to make sure the control and test seeds both receive the same amount of water. Once you have planned the investigation on rough paper and discussed it with your teacher, write up the method below (in numbered steps) explaining what you will do.</p>
          <div class="teachers-guide">
            <p>As groups are discussing their design, go around and check that they are on the right path and discuss it with them and provide help. Help learners to find ways that they can test the requirement, especially if they are looking at a favourable temperature. Perhaps you have a fridge that learners could put the seeds in? (However, remember to take into account whether the plants will receive light in the fridge). Find a suitable spot in the classroom for the control group plants, perhaps on a windowsill with light. How many seeds will the learners use for each experimental condition? Is one seed enough? What can go wrong if only one seed is used?</p>
            
            
            
            <p>A suggestion is to give learners some options for materials for germinating the seeds. For example, they could either use cotton wool, or newspaper, or soil. But, whatever they use, it must be the same in the control and test plants within one group. It does not matter if different groups do different things. This should actually be encouraged.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>Learners also need to think about how they are going to record their results before starting the investigation. If they are just seeing whether plants germinate or not, then perhaps they can draw a table. If they are going to be measuring how much the plants grow, then they will need a table for this, and they will then need to draw a graph. If they are measuring the growth of seedlings, a suggestion is to use string to measure out the height, and then to measure the length of the string on a ruler.</p>

            <strong>ANALYSIS:</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Once we have collected our results in a scientific investigation, we need to analyse them. This often involves drawing a graph. If you measured the growth of the seedlings over time, then you can draw a line graph to show this. If you have counted the number of seeds that germinated you can express this using a bar chart (provided you used the same number of seeds in each group), or you can express the percentage of seeds that germinated as a pie chart. Your teacher will help you do this. <br/><br/>

            <p>Learner-dependent answer. An example of the type of line graph which could be drawn, using the information in the second table is given below. Time will be along the independent x-axis. The height of the plants is the dependent variable and this goes along the y-axis. Both the test plants and the control plants can then be plotted on the same graph to compare the growth between the two groups. Ensure that the intervals are equal along each of the axes. On each axis the interval between points must represent an increase of the same amount! (E.g. 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. ) However, the intervals on the x-axis and the y-axis can be different in order to suit the data. For example you may use an interval of 1 on the x-axis to represent number of days, but an interval of 5 mm on the y-axis to represent change in height.</p>

        <p>Each organism is able to survive and continue to survive in their environment because they have acquired the characteristics that allow them to do things in a special way in their particular environment. We say they have adapted to life in their particular type of environment.</p>
        
        
        <div class="teachers-guide">
          <p>Learning about adaptations is a precursor to an understanding of the concepts of natural selection and evolution which will be introduced later in the term. Make sure that learners understand that organisms cannot will their bodies to change or learn to survive in a particular environment in a single generation (lifetime). These adaptations take place over many generations as a result of natural selection, in which organisms who are better adapted to their environment are more likely to thrive and have lots of off-spring. These offspring will have the genes of the parents, and will inherit the characteristics (adaptations) that made the parents better able to survive. Teachers do not need to go into any detail about natural selection yet, but should make sure that the learners are not under the impression that any organism can 'decide' to acquire an adaptation.</p>

            <p>Look at the photos of a penguin in the water and an eagle flying in the air. Both of these are birds, but they live in very different environments that make the penguin adapted for the water and the eagle adapted for flight.</p>

          <strong>Concept map</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="teachers-guide">
          <p>
            Throughout this year, we are going to develop the skill of designing and making<strong>concept maps</strong> in Natural Sciences. The 'Key concepts' listed above is a summary written out in full sentences. A concept map provides another way of representing information (ideas and concepts) in a more visual way. The benefits of a concept map are that it allows one to show the linkages between different concepts. Often a concept map has a 'focus question' around which the other concepts radiate from - in these books the focus question will be the main topic for the chapter. The relationships between different concepts are shown using arrows with linking phrases, such as 'results in', 'includes', 'can be', 'used to', 'depends on', etc.
          </p>
          
          
          
          <p>As this year progresses, learners will have to start filling in more parts of the concept maps themselves, and then hopefully draw their own ones by the end of the year. This teacher's guide contains the full version of each concept map. Encourage your learners to study the concept maps and make sense of them at the end of each chapter before doing the revision questions. Help your learners to understand and 'read' the concept maps by constructing sentences from them. For example in this case you could read: 'The biosphere is made up of dead organic matter and living things. Living things can be plants, animals or microorganisms. Living things are adapted to their environment and carry out the 7 life processes. These are &#8230;.'</p>
          
          
          
          <p>
            <strong>Learners need to learn how to learn!</strong> This is one skill which might help them later in their school career where they have a lot more information to ingest and learn and make sense of. Concept mapping is one tool to use to summarise information and also understand how different concepts link together. Real understanding and knowledge comes from grappling with the subject matter, and not just memorizing facts.

        <p>Do you know what a concept map is? This year in Natural Sciences, we are going to learn more about how to make our own concept maps.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Above you have the 'Key concepts' for this chapter. This is a written summary and the information from this chapter is summarised using words. We can also create a concept map of this chapter, which is a map of how all the concepts (ideas and topics) in this chapter fit together and are linked to each other. A concept map gives us a more visual way of summarizing information.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Different people like to learn and study in different ways: some people like to make written summaries, whilst others like to draw their own concept maps when studying and learning. These are useful skills to have, especially for later in high school and after school!</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Have a look at the concept map below for 'The Biosphere'. Complete the concept map by filling in the 7 life processes in the blank spaces.</p>

                <p>The atmosphere is the layer of gases around Earth. The atmosphere contains important gases that are key to life on Earth, namely oxygen for respiration in organisms and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis in plants. The layers of the atmosphere filter out harmful rays of the sun and hold the heat energy from the sun's rays in the atmosphere to help it maintain the necessary heat levels required for life. The weather changes occur in the lower part of the atmosphere allowing it to rain / snow / hail in order for the water cycle to get water to the plants on land.</p>
