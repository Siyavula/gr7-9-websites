    cause large numbers of people to be forced from their homes.
    Emergencies not only affect people in areas where a disaster
    took place, but also the people in the area where the</span>
    <span class="Body-bold"><b>refugees</b></span> <span>are moved to.
    People need shelter, water and food. A refugee camp has to be
    set up, and the camp needs to be very well planned</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><span>In emergencies, plans to help
    refugees need to be</span><span>made very quickly to prevent
    further suffering. Two</span><span>types of emergency

    natural disasters</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><span>In this lesson, you will learn

    while armies fight battles, people are forced to flee from

    disasters usually happen with no warning. They can create
    emergencies very quickly, which means that people have to move
    to safer areas immediately</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-3"><span>In 2000,
    a terrible flood hit Mozambique and destroyed huge areas of
    farming land. Thousands of people lost their farms and were
    forced to flee to dry ground. Refugee camps were set up in
    other parts of Mozambique and also in South Africa</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><span>A natural disaster can also
    happen over a longer period of time. In Africa, we rely on rain
    to water our crops. But this continent often has droughts.
    Droughts can create emergencies for farmers. During long
    droughts, large groups of people can be forced to leave their
    homes and their farms. These people then look for food, water
    and shelter, and they become refugees</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text"><span>Disasters such as floods and wars
    happen suddenly, which means that people have to leave their
    homes quickly. These refugees will not have a lot of food and
    water with them. They will also not have tools or materials to
    build shelters</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><span>Emergencies that happen more
    slowly over longer periods of time include droughts, or long
    wars. Refugees in situations like these have a bit more time to
    pack up their possessions and plan their journey</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3"><span>The type of emergency
    situation influences the</span> <span class="Body-bold"><b>mix of
    people</b></span> <span>in a refugee camp. Sometimes, there will be
    more men than women. Other times, there will be many babies who
    are not able to walk yet and small children. And at other
    times, there will be many elderly people who need special help
    and care</span>.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><span class="char-style-override-2"><b>Mix of people:</b></span> <span>The
      different types of people in a group, such as the young and
      the old, male and female and disabled people.</span></p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><span>For example, during a war,
    there are usually fewer men at home, because the men will be
    fighting. And during a drought, babies and elderly people may
    die since they are more vulnerable</span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><span>Different people have different
    needs for food, water and shelter. Children become dehydrated
    more quickly than adults and they also need more high-energy
    foods. Old people need more warmth and blankets</span>.</p>
