    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener para-style-override-1">In this
    chapter, you will learn how plastic waste damages the
    environment. Then you will learn how this negative impact can
    be reduced.</p>

<figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img class="frame-1" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade8-term2-web-resources/image/Tech_English_LG_Grade8-term2_p109.png" alt="Tech1_gr8_ch8_fig1.tif"/><figcaption>Figure 1: What is this swing made of?</figcaption></figure><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">Many years ago, people could only use
    the materials that they found in the <span class="char-style-override-1"><b>natural environment</b></span>. This means
    all of the natural things that are around us. It includes air,
    water, soil, plants and animals. Some examples of natural
    materials are wood, leather, clay and grass.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">Today, people use many new materials
    that are not found in the natural environment. These materials
    are made in factories. They are often made from oil or coal
    that are found under ground. This includes materials like
    plastic, certain paints, and certain fabrics used to make
    clothes. You may have heard of "polyester clothes", "PVA paint"
    and "neoprene rubber". These are called <span class="char-style-override-1"><b>synthetic materials</b></span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">Synthetic materials have many
    advantages. They are often more durable, lighter and cheaper
    than natural materials. Something is durable if it lasts for a
    long time.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">But synthetic materials also have
    disadvantages. When they are thrown away, the waste lasts a
    long time. Therefore, it is better to use synthetic materials
    over and over again. This is called <span class="char-style-override-1"><b>reusing</b></span> materials.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">Because synthetic materials are
    cheap, people can afford to buy more things that they want. One
    of the easiest ways to reduce the disadvantages of synthetic
    materials is to buy fewer things. This is called <span class="char-style-override-1"><b>reducing consumption</b></span>. Before you
    buy something new, ask yourself if you really need it.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">There is another disadvantage to
    synthetic materials that most people do not see. Harmful waste
    is often formed at the factories where the synthetic materials
    are made. This waste can end up in the air, the water and the
    soil. Modern factories are designed better than older factories
    so that they release less harmful waste into the
    environment.</p>

    <figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img class="frame-2" src="Tech_English_LG_Grade8-term2-web-resources/image/Tech_English_LG_Grade8-term2_p110.png" alt="Tech1_gr8_ch8_fig2.tif"/><figcaption>Figure 2: Waste released by a factory</figcaption></figure><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-4">One good
    idea is to keep waste of synthetic materials separate from
    waste of natural materials. This is called <span class="char-style-override-1"><b>waste separation</b></span>.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-4">Waste of
    natural materials is broken down in the natural environment to
    form harmless substances like compost. Some natural materials
    break up into harmless substances simply when they lie in the
    sun or in water for some time.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-4">A
    material is called <span class="char-style-override-1">biodegradable</span> if natural
    processes can break the material into small harmless
    pieces.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3- para-style-override-4">Materials
    that cannot break down naturally into harmless substances are
    called <span class="char-style-override-1">non-biodegradable</span> materials.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Many people throw all their
      fruit and vegetable peels on a compost heap. They also throw
      dead leaves, small tree branches and cut grass on it.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box">Over a few months, the waste on the
      compost heap changes into small dark pieces that feel like
      soft soil. This is called compost or humus. Compost is a
      valuable material, because plants grow better in soil that
      contains a lot of compost.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box">A compost heap should be kept wet,
      warm and filled with air. You can do this by covering the
      heap with a plastic sheet, and mixing the compost once a
      week.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-story"><i>Until 2003, South African shops gave
    customers free plastic bags to carry their shopping. These bags
    were very thin, and broke easily. This meant that the bags were
    thrown away after they were used.</i></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-story">Our government wanted to reduce
    plastic waste. In 2003, it banned supermarkets from giving
    customers shopping bags for free, and banned the use of very
    thin plastic shopping bags. These bags are illegal.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-story">Since then, supermarkets ask customers
    to pay for thicker, stronger shopping bags that can be used
    over and over again. The bags still look very thin, but they
    are less thin than the shopping bags used before 2003.
    Customers can choose not to buy new bags, and rather take old
    shopping bags with them to the shops.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-story">The new, thicker plastic shopping bags
    are also easier to recycle by <span class="char-style-override-3">recycling</span> factories. But this
    only helps if people separate their waste so that the plastic
    bags can be sent to a recycling factory.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Think back about what you saw when you
    were looking at the contents of dustbins and garbage bags, and
    at plastic bags lying around outside. Write a half-page report
    about this to answer these four questions:</p>
<ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><li>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging"> Do you think that
    making people pay for thicker, reusable shopping bags helps to
    reduce the amount of plastic shopping bags that people throw
    away?</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging"> Are some shops
    still giving away thin plastic shopping bags for free?</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging"> What percentage of
    people do you think put their plastic waste separate, and not
    with their other waste?</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p class="x--Body-investigation-hanging"> Are there other
    things people can do so that less plastic bags are thrown
    away?</p>

The blades of the
turbine are made of a synthetic material called âepoxy resin,â that is combined with fibres. This makes the
blades very strong, but at the same time very light. Also, it is possible to make this material into a special shape. </figcaption></figure><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Head-investigation">Next week</h3>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Next week you will be working with
    paper and cardboard in class. Instead of buying new paper and
    cardboard, you will reuse old paper and cardboard. Gather some
    paper and cardboard waste over the weekend, and bring it with
    you to school at the start of next week. Gather things like
    cardboard packaging for food.</p>
