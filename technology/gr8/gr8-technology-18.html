    connections cause problems for the country.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener">Lastly you will discuss how our
    country needs to provide access to electricity for households,
    industries and buildings such as schools and hospitals. You

    <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before electricity: Clever ways of finding and using energy</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">In earlier times, before the
    introduction of electricity, communities made clever plans to
    get light and heat − aspects of life that
    modern humans, entirely dependent on various forms of
    electricity, simply take for granted. Let's see what
    communities in our country used for fuel and lighting before
    the advent of electricity.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">African smiths discovered how to
    produce high temperatures in their village furnaces by burning
    wood. In these furnaces, they manufactured steel for weapons
    and implements. The furnaces date back over 2 000 years. Wood
    from the indigenous <span class="char-style-override-5">acacia
    robusta</span> tree, which is particularly hard and therefore
    smoulders when it is lit, was used in these Iron-age furnaces.
    The same wood was also used for cooking fires and for lighting
    purposes.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Early "ovens" that were created by
    digging large holes and lining them with dung and other
    heat-retaining substances, were also used thousands of years
    ago.</p>

    <figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img class="frame-84" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch8_fig3_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch8_fig3.tif"/> 

    <figcaption>Figure 3: A pit fire</figcaption></figure><h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Energy for heating, lighting and cooking in rural and informal settlements in the late twentieth century</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">Electricity was introduced in the
    country early in the twentieth century, but was mainly
    allocated to cities and industrial areas. As the century
    progressed, electricity reached more populated areas, but rural
    and informal settlements were still mostly not connected. As
    late as 1994, only 1% of rural households had access to
    electricity! Other methods had to be used.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above"><b>Heating</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Coal and charcoal were the fuels
    mainly used for heating in the absence of firewood. Wood was
    cheaper than coal, but it was harder to obtain because the
    areas around the settlements had been stripped by earlier
    inhabitants.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Another source of energy was gas,
    but this was also expensive, and needed special equipment such
    as gas bottles and factory-made <b>elements</b> to heat the houses and
    shacks.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Paraffin was another popular
    source of energy because it was easy to obtain and the heaters
    that burnt paraffin could be bought quite cheaply. But paraffin
    has safety concerns, which you will look at later in this
    chapter.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">A heating <b>element</b> converts electricity
      to heat through resistance encountered in the material the
      element is made of. When gas is used, the burning gas heats
      the element, which retains and radiates heat.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above"><b>Lighting</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Lighting is a necessity in daily
    life. Imagine trying to do your homework in the dark! By 1994,
    candles were still the main source of lighting in rural areas.
    Eighty-two per cent of households relied on candles to provide
    lighting after dark.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Lights using paraffin as a fuel
    source made up most of the balance − nearly
    17% of the households. People who used gas for cooking could
    also use the gas for lighting, and a few households relied on
    their wood and coal fires to provide light. Gas, wood and coal
    were not very efficient.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">A very small number of people could
    use electricity: almost less than 1% of the population of
    informal settlements.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above"><b>Cooking</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Paraffin was the fuel mostly used for
    cooking in informal settlements: over 90% of the people used
    paraffin cookers. Wood-burning and coal-burning stoves were
    used by almost all of the other households, with gas only
    occasionally being used for cooking.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Even though some areas were supplied
    with electricity, less than half of these people used it to
    cook. Stoves and electrical appliances were too expensive for
    most people living in informal settlements.</p>
<figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img class="frame-86" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch8_fig4_fmt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch8_fig4.tif"/> 

    <figcaption>Figure 4: A paraffin
    stove</figcaption></figure><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above"><b>Fire risks due to open fires as a source of energy</b></p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Open flames are always dangerous.
    Informal settlement housing is normally built from materials
    that burn easily, and the shacks and houses are often built
    very close together. People without electricity who are forced
    to use fire for heating, lighting and cooking have to be
    extremely careful. Carelessness can cause major fires. When a
    major fire occurs, emergency services have difficulty putting
    it out since there are no access roads for their fire engines
    or water points for their hoses. But due to the lack of basic
    services, such as electricity, people opt for the use of
    alternative, often dangerous, energy sources out of
    necessity.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">
      <p>A rural settlement is far away from any towns,
cities or big industries, such as mines. An informal
settlement consists of temporary houses for people
who moved closer to a town, city or industry,
usually to find work.
Rural settlements are often far away from power
stations, as well as from towns and cities where
there are already electricity transmission lines. It
is expensive to build electricity transmission lines
to far-away places. It also takes times to plan and
build them.
Some people in rural settlements cannot afford to
pay for electricity.
Informal settlements are usually built very quickly
and without planning, so there is no time to plan
or build electricity transmission lines before the
people move there.
Some people in informal settlements cannot afford
to pay for electricity either.

    put in charge of changing the way electricity is supplied to

    for all South Africans</h4>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">The South African government announced
    its policy to provide free basic services to the poor in 2000,
    the main areas of focus being free basic water, sanitation and
    power supply.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Electricity is generally cheaper than
    traditional forms of energy such as coal, paraffin, candles and
    wood. Even if the direct cost of electricity is not cheaper
    than the direct cost of wood, the indirect savings or
    advantages need to be taken into account. For example, members
    of a rural family could spend hours gathering and chopping
    firewood, hours that could be spent doing something else if
    they had electricity.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3 para-style-override-20">For the
    government to achieve their aim, about 210 000 households a
    year are being connected to the <b>national grid</b> and another 10 000
    a year are supplied with <b>renewable energy.</b></p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">The electricity network
      across South Africa is called the <b>national grid</b>. It includes
      power stations, power lines and substations.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Renewable energy</b> is energy
      that comes from resources that will not run out. The sun and
      wind are the most common sources of renewable energy.</p>
    </div>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">
      <p>Of the 12,8 million households that are electrified in
South Africa, about 52 000, mostly in rural areas, are
being supplied by basic solar power. This is when
the sunâs energy is gathered to charge batteries that
are then used to power appliances.
</p></div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">By 2013, 85% of the country had been
    given access to electricity. In 1994, only 37% of the country
    had electrical power, so it can be said that the government's
    policy is effective.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The government is also encouraging
    poorer people to get connected to the electricity system by
    offering an amount of free electricity. This is currently 50
    kWh per household, per month.</p>

      pay for energy when they use vehicles such as cars, buses and
      taxis. The petrol is the energy resource these vehicles
      need.</li>

      <li class="x--Body-text-bullet">The people also pay for
      energy when they buy food to eat. Food is the energy resource
      they need to function.</li>
    </ul><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Now he wants to ask them about the
    energy they use for heating their homes in winter, for cooking
    food and boiling water, and for light at night.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">He separates the <i>energy resources</i> from the
    <i>systems</i> they use.
    For example, paraffin is an energy resource that people pay

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">ESKOM and other companies generate
    (make) electricity and supply it to users through long wires
    called power lines. The users include shops, factories, mines
    or people who live in flats, shacks or houses. The users
    connect to the big power lines through thinner cables that go
    through metering boxes. The metering boxes measure the amount
    of energy used.</p>

    <figure xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img class="frame-100" src="Tech_English_LB_Grade8-term4_1-web-resources/image/Tech2_gr8_ch8_fig6_opt.jpeg" alt="Tech2_gr8_ch8_fig6.tif"/>

    <figcaption>Figure 7: Illegal electricity connections
    in an informal settlement. Notice that there is no control box
    at the top of the pole for measuring electricity usage or for
    cutting off the electricity in case of a short circuit.</figcaption></figure><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The electricity company needs money
    to buy coal, new generators, and to pay the people that
    maintain the generators. This is why we have to pay for
    electricity.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Electricity is not a cheap energy
    resource, which is why some people make illegal connections.
    Look at Figure 7. You can see the wires people have connected
    to an electricity pylon. These are illegal connections; the
    word "illegal" means "against the law".</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">The law says that only a qualified
    electrician can connect a building to the main electricity
    supply from the municipality, which is called "the mains". The
    mains supply electricity with an energy level of about 220
    volts. This much energy is enough to kill you. This means
    poorly connected wires can really hurt someone and cause a
    short circuit that could start a fire. You learnt about short
    circuits in Chapter 5.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Electricians have been trained to
    make proper and safe connections, and know how to connect the
    mains to the metering box. However, there are people who think
    they know how to work with electricity, and they connect wires
    to the mains on their own. Since this is illegal they don't
    connect a metering box. They will often use bare wire, without
    any insulation, that hangs in trees or lies on the ground. They
    leave wires where they can easily come into contact with
    corrugated zinc-iron walls and roofs, or gates and fences, or
    be cut by metal window-frames. They forget or don't know that
    all these metal objects can become conductors that will carry
    220 volts of electricity if they come into contact with the
    illegal live wires from the mains. These connections can easily
    cause short circuits that often cause fires in shacks and
    houses.</p>
