    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3-">In Grades 7 and 8, you learnt
    how to classify metals into <b>ferrous</b> and <b>non-ferrous</b> metals. In this
    chapter, you will revise this skill of classifying metals.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-opener--1-3-">You will learn how to preserve
    metals by painting, galvanising and electroplating. If we
    recycle materials and equipment, it will help to reduce the
    need for mining, which has a negative impact on the
    environment. You will also learn how to electroplate an
    object.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Ferrous</b> refers to the presence
      of the element iron in a metal such as steel. This generally
      makes the metal more prone to react with oxygen
      (oxidisation).</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Non-ferrous</b> metals don't
      contain iron molecules, such as aluminium, copper, zinc and
      gold. They are generally more expensive than ferrous

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above">Although metals, as we usually
    perceive them, are generally very tough, they do break down
    over time. Rust is one of <a id="Anchor"/>the most common
    ways that metals can deteriorate. Plants and animals die,
    become compost and return to the earth. When metals rust, they
    break down into smaller particles and also return to the earth.
    As you know by now, metals come from the earth originally and
    humans extract metals by mining.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">But what causes metals to rust?
    Sometimes a chemical reaction occurs between a metal and
    oxygen. This is called oxidisation, which results in rust.
    Another word for rust is corrosion. Ferrous metals are not
    resistant to corrosion. This reaction happens much faster when
    there is salt or certain acids in the air as well. For example,
    metals close to the sea tend to rust a lot quicker than metals
    inland. Figure 3 shows an example of this.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">However, there are ways of protecting
    metals against oxidisation. The cheapest way of preserving
    ferrous metals is by painting the exposed surface.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">How do you paint metal? That depends
    on whether it is a brand new piece of metal or a piece of metal
    that has already rusted.</p>

</figure>

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">If it is a brand-new, smooth piece of
    metal that has never been painted before, it is best to first
    roughen the surface a bit. It is difficult for paint to stick
    to a very smooth surface. To roughen the surface, you can use
    wire brush such as the one shown in Figure 4 or sandpaper as
    shown in Figure 5. Make sure that there is no dust on the
    surface. You can wipe it with a clean cloth to get rid of dust.
    Then you must apply one, or preferably two, coats of primer.
    Primer protects the metal and makes it easier for the top coat
    of paint to stick to the metal's surface. Finally, you can
    apply the top coat of paint.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Painting a rusted piece of metal
    is a bit more difficult. First, you need to get rid of as much
    rust as possible. If there is old, flaky paint, you must remove
    that as well. A wire brush and sandpaper work well for this. It
    is hard to get rid of all the rust, therefore you need to apply
    a special primer to stop the oxidisation. If you don't use a
    special primer, the metal will keep rusting underneath the
    paint, which will make the paint come off after a while.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-heading">Important things to keep in
      mind when you paint:</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-numbers">1. Always wait till the paint
      you've applied is completely dry before you apply another
      coat.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-numbers">2. Always make sure that the
      surface is clean before you paint it. There must be no dust
      or oil on it. Dust and oil prevent paint from sticking to the
      surface.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Certain types of primers meant to
    stop rusting still require another primer to be painted on top
    of it, before you can apply the final coat of paint.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">You have to read the instructions for
    the specificproduct carefully before buying or using it. When
    you've applied all the relevant primers, you can apply your top
    coat of paint. Now you know how to fix rusted things and make
    them beautiful again, instead of just throwing them away!</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">
      <p>Apart from painting, we can also protect ferrous
metals from corrosion by applying a thin coat of
zinc. This process is called <b>galvanisation.</b>
</p>

<p>Zinc also oxidises or rusts, but then the zinc
rust reacts with the oxygen, water and carbon
dioxide in the air and turns into “zinc carbonate”.
</p>
<p>Zinc carbonate is quite tough and consequently
it protects the metal underneath it. If the zinc
carbonate layer gets damaged, more zinc carbonate
forms. This can repeat until there is no zinc left on
the metal. Then the metal will start to rust.
</p>
<p>This means that galvanisation only slows down the
corrosion of a metal. It doesn’t prevent corrosion
completely. If you need to protect metal properly for
a very long time, it is best to galvanise and paint the
metal, which is what people do with cars today.
</p>
      </div>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside"><p>The word <b>galvanisation</b>
comes from Luigi Galvani’s
name. He was an Italian
doctor and scientist who did
experiments with electric
currents in the eighteenth
century.
</p>
</div>
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body--above">There are two ways of galvanising
    metal. The one process is called "hot-dip galvanisation". The
    other process is called "electro-galvanisation".</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">Hot-dip galvanisation means that
    the ferrous metal gets dipped into a bath of <b>molten</b> zinc at a temperature of
    460°. Water boils
    more or less at 100°,
    so you can imagine how hot that zinc is! Obviously, you need to
    do this with the right equipment and safety measures.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent"><b>Molten</b>: a metal or rock that
      is in liquid form as a result of great heat.</p>
    </div>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent">Hot-dip galvanisation has two
    definite advantages: it is relatively inexpensive and it is
    also very tough, because the zinc layer resulting from this
    process is thick. This makes it suitable for outdoor use, even
    over extended periods of time, such as 20 to 50 years. But
    there are drawbacks too. Firstly, the metal needs to go through
    a complex preparation process before it can be dipped into the
    molten zinc. Figure 7 shows these processes. It also makes the
    metal look dull and the zinc coating is not the same thickness
    throughout.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent"><span class="Strong char-style-override-7">Electro-galvanisation</span>
    means that the ferrous metal gets coated with zinc through a
    process called electroplating. You will learn more about
    electroplating in the next part of this chapter. For now, you
    only need to know that the zinc layer through
    electro-galvanisation is thinner than the hot-dip zinc layer
    and not as tough, but it is the same thickness throughout. The
    zinc coating is also generally shinier and even small objects
    can easily be electro-galvanised. This means that
    electro-galvanised metals are more commonly used indoors. For
    outdoor use, it will definitely have to be painted to make it
    last longer.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text"><span class="Strong char-style-override-7">Galvanising is a process that
    prevents corrosion. When galvanising metal, the objects are
    coated with zinc. This is relatively inexpensive and does not
    react with air and moisture, as iron does. The zinc layer
    separates the iron from the oxygen and moisture. Objects that
    have been galvanised are not completely protected from rust.
    They only take longer to rust. To protect a metal completely,
    it is best to galvanise and paint it.</span></p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="note">
      <p>Electroplating is a process whereby one metal is
coated with a thin layer of another metal by using
electricity and salty water (or an <b>electrolyte</b>).
</p>
<p>People do electroplating for a number of reasons.
One reason could be to protect the metal from
corrosion, such as galvanisation. Another reason
could be to make an inexpensive metal look better.
</p>
<p>For example, copper or silver jewellery is often gold
plated to make it look more expensive.
</p>
      </div>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p>An <b>electrolyte</b> is a mixture
of salt and water that has the
ability to conduct electricity.
</p>
      </div>
      
    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent para-style-override-8">Look at Figure
    8 and 9. In practice, electroplating works like this:</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">The object that you want coated
    gets connected to the negative side of an electric cell with a
    wire. The metal that you want to coat the object with gets
    connected to the positive side of the cell with a wire. Put the
    object and the metal, with the wires attached, into a container
    with the water and salt mixture.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-indent-1-3">What happens next is that
    electricity and metal molecules travel from the positive side
    to the negative side. This means that after a while, a thin
    layer of metal starts to form on the object. The longer you let
    this process continue, the thicker the metal layer will be.</p>

    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="aside">
      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Table salt is one example of
      a salt. Not all salts are edible, but all salts contain a
      metal as one of their elements. For example, table salt
      consists of sodium, which is a metal, and chlorine. You can't
      use table salt for electroplating.</p>

      <p class="x--Body-box-no-indent">Copper sulphate is also a
      salt. It contains copper, which is a metal, and sulphur.
      However, copper sulphate is VERY POISONOUS. You can use it
      for electroplating, but definitely not for food.</p>

    <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="x--Body-Text">You have learnt three methods of
    protecting ferrous metals against corrosion: painting,
    galvanisation and electroplating. Protecting metals against
    corrosion makes the metals last longer, which could reduce the
    need for mining. You can also easily reuse a rusted piece of
    metal if you clean the rust off and paint it.</p>

    materials will have a positive impact on the environment.</p>
